 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_YEVDOKIA_BERSHANSKAYA_DESC:0 "Yevdokia Davidovna Bershanskaya sought to follow in the footsteps of her parents, who were killed supporting the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. As soon as she turned eighteen, she enrolled in aviation school, becoming a pilot and instructor. When the Germans invaded, three all-female bomber regiments were formed: the 586th and 587th Aviation Regiments, and the 588th Night Bombers' Regiment. Bershanskaya, already an experienced aviatrix with a decade's worth of experience under her belt, was selected to lead the 588th. The Regiment's operating conditions were far from ideal: they were forced to use outdated biplanes, and the only way to stay concealed was to turn off their engines and glide to their targets. But despite these limitations, the Regiment was immensely successful on its raids, and the Germans nicknamed them the "Night Witches."\n\nThe Soviet Air Forces' chain of command was shattered following the chaotic evacuation of Moscow, but the 588th and several other regiments rallied around Bershanskaya to stay organized. She was able to maintain a steady and organized retreat, with her ramshackle air force finally relocating to a makeshift airstrip outside the Siberian city of Surgut. In the following years, the self-proclaimed "Free Aviators" built up their forces using the remnants of the Soviet industry in Arkhangelsk, scavenged wrecks, and home workshops, while their core of veteran pilots trained a new wave of recruits. They were a valuable boon during the West Russian War, and they were able to maintain much of their strength after the war's end. Even today, Bershanskaya still organizes fighter sorties to fend off Luftwaffe bombing raids."

 FAV.2.desc:0 "Whilst is is not uncommon for us to receive donations or even tribute from some of the warlords in response to our efforts to defend the skies of Russia, we have received a gift from a more unexpected source. Towards Moskowien lies the region of Vyatka which has, it seems, become the 'Empire' of 'Emperor' Vladimir the first.\n\nModelling himself as 'the alternative' to Bolshevik and fascist rulers, he is seemingly gaining some degree of support in West Russia and has decided to show us his 'gratitude' for our service in protecting the skies as best we can. At his own expense, the Emperor has donated a number of aircraft to further aid our efforts. We suspect whilst there is truth to his desire to thank us, there is a large element of him trying to secure our support for his regime. Regardless, we have sent our gratitude for the donation."

Manpower is scarce and precious, and the Free Aviators must balance §GGround Crew§! and §PPilots§! carefully, to ensure mission-readiness and an ability to replace losses. New pilots and ground crew shall be recruited every 30 days.\n\nThe COMBAT menu covers missions against the Germans. In this menu, aircraft will be committed directly to combat, or placed in reserve for later use. The aircraft directly in use will be able to fly against German incursions - an intelligence event covering German activity will fire every 30 days. Aircraft that are kept in reserve cannot fight, but are immune to being destroyed. The strength of the Luftwaffe Bombing of West Russia will be directly dependent on how this is handled.\n\nFinally, the DIPLOMACY menu shall serve as a means of acquiring §gScrap Metal§!, extra §PPilots§! and §GGround Crew§!, and aircraft, at the cost of changing various warlords' §Yinfluence§! over the Free Aviators.

 ### National ideas ###
 FAV_night_witches:0"Night Witches"
 FAV_night_witches_desc:0"We have never stopped fighting. Not in the war, not in the frenzy of evacuation, and not over the long years of disorder and collapse that followed. We have always been there, rising to combat the German invaders, even as others who claimed to do so fell into internecine conflict. But we did not, will not, ever stop. When the Germans come in their bombers, preparing to rain death upon the peoples of Russia, we respond. We avenge. And, far more often than they would like to admit, we win. Many years ago the Germans, in their fear, named us the 'Night Witches.' Their pilots of today will again learn the reason for that moniker, preferably as their crippled aircraft speed, ever faster, towards the ground. With them inside."
 FAV_aerial_society:0"Aerial Society"
 FAV_aerial_society_desc:0"The disproportionate numbers of pilots and aircraft in our lands, together with the experiences and outlooks of our leadership, have resulted in every societal problem being looked at through an aerial lens. We compensate for poor infrastructure with airbridges. We use long-endurance reconnaissance aircraft instead of traditional border patrols. As well as much more besides. Every question posed has an answer in the skies, and we will prove it."
 FAV_collective_improvisation:0"Collective improvisation"
 FAV_collective_improvisation_desc:0"Our lands are barren, to put it mildly. Despite this, we maintain an air force capable of challenging, and occasionally defeating, the mighty Luftwaffe, and we do this through extreme improvisation. Whether it is replacing high-performance engines with those from tractors, distilling grain alcohol to replace aviation fuel, or repairing damaged metal wings with fabric and wood, we figure out a way to make do. This attitude towards collaborative improvisation permeates our society, ensuring that whatever the challenge encountered our people, instead of succumbing to despair or defeat, work together to find an innovative solution."
