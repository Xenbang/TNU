 UKH_zhukovs_fiefdom:0 "Zhukov's Fiefdom"
 UKH_zhukovs_fiefdom_desc:0 "Ukhta is the industrial center of the Front, as far from the bombers as they can reach it, and blessed with oil reserves. From his assignment in the frozen North, General Georgy Zhukov surveys the extraction operations and trade deals with the further-east warlords, bargaining for more oil and materiel from the East.\n\nThis assignment, conveniently, also places him out of range of Arkhangelsk, and well away from the power struggles that blight the city..."

 UKH_zhukovs_domain_desc:0 "After the conclusion of the West Russian War and the subsequent retreat of the West Russian Revolutionary Front to the northern outskirts of Russia, Marshal Zhukov found himself governing his own district of Ukhta. Although Grand Marshal Voroshilov's trust is honorable, his intention was clear from the very beginning. With two great and influential generals in the court of Arkhangelsk, the solution was clear: to isolate these two from one another. After all, the Grand Marshal might have reasoned, a house divided by itself cannot stand.\n\nHowever, Marshal Voroshilov is old, and as time goes on in the cold northern lands, his time shortens, bit by bit. For now, our Marshal Zhukov must bide his time. In the meantime, there is much work to be done. We will secure our political hold over Ukhta, as well as ensure the steady flow of oil over the territory. The day will come when the Zhukov himself would lead the world revolution."
 UKH_new_deals_with_khanty_mansi_desc:0 "To the east of Ukhta lies the lands of Yugra, a region ruled by criminal syndicates that took power there after the collapse of Union authority after the Great Patriotic War. Though it disgusts our officers and workers to the very core to work with criminals, with the dire food crisis throughout the whole of the Front, it is preferable than to let the Revolution's fires starve and die. For now, our practical concerns matter far more than our principles. The Revolution must survive.\n\nOur dealings with the outlaws, in their current form, are not satisfactory. With German bombs hammering Russian territory, the Front can perhaps come to a new agreement with the syndicates. Many in the old Union would consider these talks as treason to the ideals of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but have they lived through these times of chaos and strife? We are but hands clasping a flame in the cold wastes, a Prometheus waiting to give fire to humanity."
 UKH_continue_importing_extraction_equipment_desc:0 "When the Front first arrived in Northern Russia, it found itself in a world of lack: food supplies dwindling, munitions and weapon spare parts running low. It all but seemed that the light of the Revolution in Russia was dying, its embers cast out in the winter winds. Then the Front discovered the oil reserves in Ukhta and began digging, fuel being the most valuable currency in the shattered Union. However, the Front did not account for this possibility, and as such, it had to acquire the means to extract these reserves in other ways.\n\nThese are now in Marshal Zhukov's hands, lying on the ground waiting for the spigots to open, and let flow the black stream into the world. To ensure a steady stream of this valuable substance, we will continue to import extraction equipment under German bombing, whether it be from Finland or the lands of the East. The revolution will burn again, as we will pour fuel into the fire."
 UKH_expand_quota_production_desc:0 "The deals with the outlaws are secure; the extraction equipment that we paid good money for has arrived, and oil is flowing out steadily from Ukhta to the rest of the Front. While the fate of the Revolution is still up in the air, it is now far more stable. With the negotiations with the criminals done, any of our excess oil will be worth more in the eastern market. Now the only thing that remains for Marshal Zhukov is to capitalize on this.\n\nOur officers will seek out workers and hire them to work in the camouflaged oil derricks of the North. With the new equipment in mind, we shall also expand the quotas for oil all across the board. It shall no longer be a stream but a flood instead. Our excess revenue will go to feed the soldiers of Ukhta and arm them, for war is always waiting in the corner. No longer shall a soldier of socialism suffer from lack or hunger."
 UKH_red_army_labor_battalions_desc:0 "From the start of the Union to its end, soldiers of socialism have been in their cores workers, whose only occupation is the defense of the revolution against revisionism and reaction. This commonality has extended into even the times of the Front and the West Russian War, where their labor and blood paid for what was ultimately a failed attempt to repulse the Germans from the homeland of the socialism. Of the light that guided humankind through the darkness of this Earth, only a flicker of embers remains.\n\nWith no wars to fight the troops must work. The officers and political commissars will travel and form labor battalions to help with the construction and camouflage of oil extraction equipment. They will repair roads and rebuild infrastructure where it is necessary and efficient to do so. For now, we must put down our swords and take to the plowshares; but wars are not fought by might alone."
 UKH_concessions_to_workers_desc:0 "It was no surprise to the Front when it arrived in the North that it had to compromise with the safety and rights of workers. After all, if the Revolution was to continue, everyone has to pull their weight in these tumultuous times. Yet, labor shortages persist, with the people of Ukhta unwilling to join in arms as comrades against the fascist enemy. The Front cannot harm the body from which it draws its power and legitimacy, and as such, these shortages continue to plague it.\n\nMarshal Zhukov has come up with a solution to improve the Ukhtans' will to work; he has promised to expand their rights and increase their wages, hoping to draw more workers with the promises of better living standards. No more long work hours, and bare rations will no longer be a commons sight. The march to communism is a long and rocky road, but with all bearing their burdens, the day is closer with every passing of dawn."
 UKH_survey_new_wells_desc:0 "With the arrival of our new mining equipment, the quotas of oil production in Ukhta has never been higher, nor have they ever been quite so easy to achieve. The tanks, planes, and trucks of the Front are now ensured a steady supply from the oil wells of Ukhta, ready for war and conflict at any moment they may arise. The deals with Yugra has benefitted us much as well; these outlaws and criminals have their uses, even if they are future enemies than comrades.\n\nHowever, socialism demands excellence from all of us. A mere enough is not sufficient from Marshal Zhukov. Surely, lying deep within the lands of Ukhta, there is more oil to be found, waiting for us to discover them. We will send our surveyors to the sites where we suspect more might be and build new derricks as we find new sources. Under socialism, none shall again know lack, but only plenty."
 UKH_pipeline_to_vorkuta_desc:0 "To the northeast of Ukhta lies the old and cold lands encompassing Vorkuta, a nominal part of the Front housing prisoners of the old Union days. Ruled by the iron fist of Vasily Blokhin, the Front sends the worst of its population and soldiery there, sentenced to hard labor in the relentless cold of the Russian north. Life there is difficult, and not many sent there ever returned to the Front. Perhaps an alternate path to redemption could be found for these inmates yet.\n\nHowever, Blokhin is not a man of soft temperaments. Without any deal, the hands that grip these prisoners will never let go. Thus we come forward to him with one. The pipelines of Ukhta will flow into the prison camps of Vorkuta, providing its residents, either guard or captive, with warmth and fuel. In exchange, he will return prisoners with good behavior to us, for their labor. Perhaps in the far future, these institutions will not be needed any longer."
 UKH_protecting_the_wells_desc:0 "With the problem of labor and deals with both the criminals in Yugra as well as the prisoners of Vorkuta concluded, food and work are starting to pour into the Ukhta, and from here, to the Front as a whole. Far from just surviving, the troops of Ukhta, under the guidance of the ever-wise and vigilant comrade Marshal Zhukov, have made out of their circumstances a prosperous state of affairs.\n\nLife in a Russia torn apart by revisionism and German bombing, however, is hard. Banditry plague the land, while bombers stalk the air, their prey being the same in Ukhta: the oil derricks. We will protect these by assigning more troops to guard duty at night, and during the day, soldiers will conceal them from bombing. While the Front has to hide and conceal itself for now, it shall not throw itself away in vain pursuit. The day will come when the Germans rue their decision to make war on the homeland of the Revolution."
 UKH_mission_accomplished_desc:0 "Marshal Zhukov has performed his duty in Ukhta admirably. He, along with the forces of the Front posted here, has increased production quotas of oil and exceeded them more often than not. The question of labor and work has solved itself as well, with workforces pouring from the population of Ukhta, troops of the Front, and prisoners of Vorkuta. The deals with the criminals of Yugra, although not fully adhering to the ideals of the Front, has benefitted us greatly in the face of the German bombing.\n\nIt is time to report to Arkhangelsk. The Grand Marshal would be pleased to hear his protege and trusted subordinate to have done such magnificent work. Perhaps with this done, the scales of power in Arkhangelsk would shift themselves to be in favor of our dear Marshal Zhukov. Then and only then, as the legitimate successor to the legacy of Grand Marshal Voroshilov and the old Union, shall Zhukov lead the world revolution."
