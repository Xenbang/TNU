### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_YEVGENY_DRAGUNOV_DESC:0 "The scion of a long line of Russian gunsmiths, lead practically flows through Yevgeny Fyodorovich Dragunov's veins. He took up the family profession in his youth, and soon applied those skills to the service of the Motherland as a senior armorer in the Red Army. He was fortunate enough to be stationed in the Siberian city of Zlatoust, far away from the carnage of the front lines; however, Dragunov's fortunes would not end there, as the dreadful wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union left Dragunov as the de facto mayor over the city. Dragunov led Zlatoust in upscaling the arms manufacturing industry into becoming its main export, allowing the city to claim immense profits in the bloodbaths the Russians would wage against one another in the years to come. Dragunov's fortunes only improved further when the esteemed engineer Mikhail Kalashnikov arrived in his city, where the two secured a close friendship and a profitable fusion of their technical skills to design the greatest weapons the Russian people had ever seen.\n\nUnlike many of the other warlords in post-Soviet Russia, Dragunov has no delusions of grandeur about reuniting the Union or sacking Germania. He certainly wouldn't mind those, but he's more preoccupied with profit than anything else. Zlatoust has become an island of prosperity and stability in a sea of chaos thanks to its arms trade, and he intends to keep it that way. There are few people he would refuse to sell to, and he's always eager to find more customers. And in the coming years, he expects business to be positively booming..."

### Focus Trees ###
 UDM_speculation_and_accumulation:0 "Speculation and Accumulation"
 UDM_speculation_and_accumulation_desc:0 "Russia is a harsh, harsh place. Warlords rise and fall, governments come into power get overthrown within the same day, and the common russian is starving in a hut on a piece of land controlled by a nameless warlord. Despite these unfortunate events, our arms industry has been constantly thriving, with people flocking to our nation in droves to work and serve the Republic. We churn out cheap reliable designs constantly and our business is always in the black, no matter what occurs. Our republic is a light in the darkness of the Siberian wastes, and as long as our citizens and our business prosper, the Republic will prosper. One of the most important aspects of running a successful business, however, is a plan, and with the tides west churning ominously, our best course of action is to review our said plan for it and see what we need to improve to fulfill the needs of our citizens and our customers."

 UDM_stock_up:0 "Stock Up"
 UDM_stock_up_desc:0 "With so many battles and wars being waged all around us, we have constant orders of rifles, Anti-Aircraft Guns, rockets, shells, and munitions to keep track of. While these operations have been unprecedentedly successful, some cracks have, unfortunately, began to gleam in the foundations of our industry. The continuous flow of orders has grown difficult, and hundreds of workers and pieces of machinery have been lost on the assembly line; sometimes because of exhaustion, and sometimes they just fall apart. If this strain continues to plague us, our production could come screeching to a halt, losing our claim to the Republic and any sense of prosperity we've built up for so long. Constructing a stockpile of industrial materials and weaponry would make sure that we always have something to sell, while keeping ourselves supplies if our rivals decide to meet us on the front lines."

 UDM_the_frontlines:0 "The Frontlines"
 UDM_the_frontlines_desc:0 "Siberia is a brutal region. Only the strong survive, and only those who forge the tools for the strong will prosper. The Free City of Zlatoust is surrounded by bandits, mercenaries, and revolutionary fools whose egos and militias believe they have the right to call themselves a "nation." In this dangerous position, we have managed to secure several advantages, however: the Yugran thugs and bandits to the north offer extremely lucrative profits, while the Juntas and Dictatorships surrounding us are some of our most loyal customers. While we have secured a stable position, it's time that the Republic reorganizes its operations and renegotiates some of the dealings with our partners, to keep customers coming, citizens safe, and profits soaring. After all, coming for the money and finding the marauders would look bad, wouldn't it?"

 UDM_flex_our_muscle:0 "Flex Our Muscle"
 UDM_flex_our_muscle_desc:0 "Some of our neighbors have been getting a bit bold with us. Payments are being delayed, the raids on the borders seem to be getting more and more frequent, and petty bandit gangs attempt to steal whatever weapons and ammunition they can from our stockpiles. The Republic needs to show those around it that we are not some warlord. We are a proud republic that is one of the few safe places in this harsh region. The Republic of Zlatoust is not to be trifled with, and we will keep our people safe and our bottom line intact no matter the cost."

 UDM_control_the_roads:0 "Control the Roads"
 UDM_control_the_roads_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe bombings, while very limited in our area due to our thriving anti-aircraft gun factory, still hit our roads, especially in the borderlands. Our roads and infrastructure is our most important aspect, and we need to rebuild what is destroyed and repave what has been worn down. To rebuild these roads, however, we will need money. One of our supplementary sources of revenue we can use for rebuilding is our toll systems across the country; however, with citizens seizing control of the toll stations or bandits raiding them for money, they have become defunct in recent years. Sending in the police forces will guarantee the safety of our roads, while securing the funds the Republic needs from each and every traveller passing through. In the end, this protection will finally allow us to guarantee our deliveries are made rightly and properly."

 UDM_the_yugra_connection:0 "The Yugra Connection"
 UDM_the_yugra_connection_desc:0 "The Republic has always had a good relationship with the Yugrans, but lately with the bandit raids and the mobs of brigands that have been crossing their border into ours, we have hit a rough patch. Sending the Republic's best diplomats will be a great way to reaffirm our good intentions and will hopefully allow us to discuss a new treaty. This proposed concordat would establish a mutual alliance between the Republic and the Yugrans, along with several economically beneficent clauses, and a signature of mutual defense. We need as many friends as we can get in this harsh world, and the Yugrans are our best bet."

 UDM_a_mercenary_state:0 "A Mercenary State"
 UDM_a_mercenary_state_desc:0 "Our glorious republic musters a small, but highly trained and exceptionally equipped army. However, with the deterioration of the situation in the west, and with many Warlords wanting to expand and even unify Russia, we need to increase our defensive capabilities. We have a limited manpower pool, so hiring Mercenaries, specifically from Yugra, wouldn't be a bad idea. By spending some coin to hire, equip, and house a group of mercenaries, we will keep our men out of combat unnecessarily and have an expandable force to police our borders and attack any bandits that try to steal from our stockpiles."

 UDM_pay_to_pass:0 "Pay to Pass"
 UDM_pay_to_pass_desc:0 "The Republic is a light in the darkness of Russia, and we offer what many warlords around can't: Stability, Safety, Prosperity, and Liberty. By showing those who surround us these benefits that we offer, we can increase immigration. This should be a priority, as more immigrants means more workers, more soldiers, more scientists, and more people to boost our population. The Republic needs to grow, and the more of our brethren that come in, the more we can grow and flourish in this wasteland. Propaganda leaflets and signs along our most traveled roadways would help convince travelers to stay in Zlatoust and contribute their skills to the Republic."

 UDM_free_to_stay:0 "Free to Stay"
 UDM_free_to_stay_desc:0 "Zlatoust has one of the most advanced and well kept infrastructure systems in all of Russia. We are a major transport hub of goods and people between the various warlords, and a good way to take advantage of our situation would be to open up our roads to other states, for a price of course. By allowing our neighbors to pay to pass through our area, we can have a source of constant, lucrative income for as long as trade continues, and perhaps entice some people to stay..."

 UDM_guns_for_the_men:0 "Guns for the Men"
 UDM_guns_for_the_men_desc:0 "The recent influx of new troops and mercenaries has led us to require more weapons to arm them. Our industry is struggling to keep up without sacrificing some of our other profitable production lines. Diverting our industry, for the short term at least, is the only solution we have. We will limit production of artillery rockets and tanks, and shift them over to the AK-47M. Another plan the administration has drafted is the purchasing of older, outdated weaponry from bandits and warlords looking to acquire some quick cash. It will be quicker, but it may leave some of our newer recruits disadvantaged in terms of firepower."

 UDM_theres_always_a_price:0 "Theres Always a Price"
 UDM_theres_always_a_price_desc:0 "As a beacon of capitalist spirit in Siberia, numerous corporations run weapons factories, without state owned manufacturers making the advanced weapons being the backbone of our economy. We normally let most companies proceed without intervention, but this time, something has gone wrong. One of our T-55 factories has fallen silent, as most warlords can't afford to use armor. Hundreds are out of work, but the government has a solution. We will buy the factory, retool it to make more profitable, and restore the jobs of the men and women who have been out of work."

 UDM_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns:0 "We're the Only Ones Selling Guns"
 UDM_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns_desc:0 "The Republic has been blessed with a vast amount of wood, steel, and technical knowledge, which allowed us to start our massive arms industry. The Luftwaffe rarely flies over our country, due to our vast Anti-Air defenses and the presence of the Free Aviators nearby. This has allowed us to consolidate our position in these dangerous wastes; furthermore, our security has allowed us to gain a monopoly of the arms industry against all of our neighbors, as each and every single one of them know that only we can produce high quality weapons in a massive quantity. Our reputation of cheap, rugged, and effective equipment draws buyers from across Russia. We have consolidated out position, and it is about time that we start to review our processes. We will take our profits and work on developing new rifles, tanks, and artillery pieces to enhance our portfolio, and improve our industrial methods so we can make our weapons faster and cheaper than anyone else can."

 UDM_the_siberian_mediator:0 "The Siberian Mediator"
 UDM_the_siberian_mediator_desc:0 "The Republic is well loved throughout Russia, though this more comes out of your business dealings than a genuine alliance. We are a neutral nation, and unlike the Front, the Tsar, or our neighbors to the east, The Republic has no desire to unify Russia. Our neutrality puts us in a unique position. By establishing offices and departments which communicate with other warlords, we can keep them from completely annihilating one another unnecessarily. This reorganization will also help business, because if we allow these mediations to happen here, we can skim the top of these deals for our pleasantries as a host."

 UDM_the_bullish_charge:0 "The Bullish Charge"
 UDM_the_bullish_charge_desc:0 "Our Shining Republic is the only government of its kind in Western Siberia. We are surrounded by authoritarian governments, fiefdoms, and squabbling military men. A way for us to increase our immigration, and in turn our workforces, is to distribute leaflets and other forms of pro-government media to our citizens and the surrounding population, so they can see how and why we are a more wealthy, stable, and prosperous option in this cold and harsh world."

 UDM_dig_in:0 "Dig In"
 UDM_dig_in_desc:0 "We have no desire to reunify Siberia under our flag, let alone Russia. Our profits are made from conflict, and us staying out of said conflict. By increasing patrols, constructing forts, and increasing the size of our military, we will be able to protect the sovereignty of our shining republic from the various rabble-rousers around us, who want to loot our armories and plunder our wealth."

 UDM_sell_off_our_stock:0 "Sell Off Our Stock"
 UDM_sell_off_our_stock_desc:0 "The recent projects to improve the living standard of our citizens have sapped our treasury, and it would be a good idea to look into other forms of making money, other than selling our weapons to other nations. By selling our surplus weaponry to private security firms, we will be able to boost our profits conventionally, while selling to more..."extraordinary" clients will get us some "off the books" earnings as well."

 UDM_the_yugran_defense:0 "The Yugran Defense"
 UDM_the_yugran_defense_desc:0 "Us and our neighbors, the Yugrans, have common interests. We both seek to survive in the rough waters of Western Siberia, and we both want to fulfill our interests without meddling from other warlords with more conventional power. We will send one of the best diplomats in our republic to see if we can write an agreement of mutual defense, so both of our nations will be able to continue on our paths with a sense of security."

 UDM_fortify_zlatoust:0 "Fortify Zlatoust"
 UDM_fortify_zlatoust_desc:0 "Our republic's shining capital and industrial center are in a precarious position. While we are in the mountains, which is very defensible terrain, we border a significant amount of neighbors, and the best way to secure the safety and stability of the republic is to build up defenses in and around the city. Mines, bunkers, pillboxes and anti-tank guns will all be prepared and maintained so our citizens and workers and rest easy, knowing that they and their families are safe."

 UDM_the_all_russian_contractor:0 "The All-Russian Contractor"
 UDM_the_all_russian_contractor_desc:0 "Just because our republic doesn't seek to raise its flag over the Kremlin, doesn't mean that we do not want to show our influence in other ways. By offering our men and time to the petty bandit kings and old Soviet generals surrounding us, we can gain extra funds and we can give our men real combat experience, without exposing the republic to any of the conventional repercussions of war."

 UDM_surpassing_forecasts:0 "Surpassing Forecasts"
 UDM_surpassing_forecasts_desc:0 "Our Republic is rich, strong, and thriving. Every Machination of war, from the Kalashnikovs to the RPG-7s to the T-64s are being produced at a record rate and exported across the vast wastes of Russia. Our beacon of democracy provides a light in the darkness of this cold world. Now that we have secured the republic's position in the short term, it is time to look within our borders and focus on making further improvements to our people's daily lives and our profit margins."

 UDM_the_home_front:0 "The Home Front"
 UDM_the_home_front_desc:0 "Our citizens have better conditions than nearly any other Russian, barring the Tsars in the west and east, but that isn't saying much. While they are protected by the anti-aircraft guns that we produce, they are still victim to the occasional raid. While they do not live in the basic huts and bombed out buildings that many of their former countrymen reside in, they barely have any heat in the cold winter months, The Republic's efforts shall go to making sure that our constituents are happy, healthy, warm, well-fed and protected."

 UDM_double_our_portfolio:0 "Double Our Portfolio"
 UDM_double_our_portfolio_desc:0 "The industry of the Republic is already thriving, with guns and takes being made in the dozens every day; however, the Republic never seems satisfied with our profits. In recognizing this dissatisfaction from out people, and in order to bolster our coffers, we shall begin to seek further improvements of our current production methods. By investing a large amount of money to build new factories, procure new production equipment, and hire new workers, we will be able to exponentially grow the production capacity of the Republic. Our people will soon know a new age of prosperity and happiness, and this is just the start of our plans."

 UDM_guns_for_factories:0 "Guns for Factories"
 UDM_guns_for_factories_desc:0 "We have many contacts across the world who also would like to see the Republic's business endeavors prove successful. One part of the Republic's new initiative to increase goods production and living conditions of our citizens is to procure new equipment for our factories. By reaching out to fellow warlords, emigres, and foreign agents, the Republic will be able to secure new machines and ammunition to increase our production. This will increase our output capacity by leaps and bounds, which in turn will increase our profits by an even larger amount."

 UDM_expanding_the_sprawl:0 "Expanding the Sprawl"
 UDM_expanding_the_sprawl_desc:0 "Zlatoust and Nizhny Tagil are our most populous cities and are among the biggest production centers in all of Russia. The Republic has already invested a great amount in our industry, and it is now time to focus on the Republic's most important asset: our citizens. We will invest further money into the well-being of our citizens by building new apartments and suburbs around our main industrial centers, and we will also construct new factories making both weapons and consumer goods for export, and our citizen's enjoyment."

 UDM_the_industry_never_ends:0 "The Industry Never Ends"
 UDM_the_industry_never_ends_desc:0 "The Republic is booming! Profit margins are going up, equipment is being produced at a record rate and our citizens are happier and healthier than ever, but we can make some improvements. The Republic has vast stretches of land untouched by the hand of industry, and a way to further increase our profit is to start zoning off the land so we can construct Industrial Parks for the Republic. This creates additional jobs in terms of those who are clearing the land and those who are working in the factories, allowing the Republic's citizens to secure a livelihood."

 UDM_dynamic_revolution:0 "Dynamic Revolution"
 UDM_dynamic_revolution_desc:0 "The Republic is surrounded by despots, communists, and authoritarians. Their people are suffering under the boot of the oppressive regimes that rule over them, and it is in the Republic's best interest to engage in covert operations to further democracy. By arming insurgents in our neighbor's territory, we have a slight chance to weaken our neighbors, and the internal strife that is created will open up new markets for the Republic's weapons to be sold and used. The Republic stands for two things: profits and democracy, and these operations will make sure that both those things are fulfilled."

 UDM_replace_and_restore:0 "Replace and Restore"
 UDM_replace_and_restore_desc:0 "The Republic's urban centers are modern, but on the outskirts, there are a significant amount of dilapidated and unsafe buildings, and the infrastructure in many places that connect our cities and industrial parks are old and cracking. Using the money from our investments into our domestic matter and our profits from the tolls on the trade roads, the Republic will be able to repair its roads and we will be able to start a new program to refurbish and renovate our many housing projects."

 UDM_guns_like_no_other:0 "Guns Like No Other"
 UDM_guns_like_no_other_desc:0 "We have the most advanced firearms, artillery guns, rockets, and tanks in all of Russia. We churn out dozens and dozens of munitions daily, but the Republic cannot afford to be complacent. Our Mayor-Consul, Yevgeny Dragunov, and his partner, Mikhail Kalashnikov, are also heads of the state design-bureau, and they both are responsible for creating the weapons that the Republic churns out daily. They have decided that it is now time to reactivate the bureau and invest heavily in our Research and Development divisions so we can create new and improved weapons and methods of production."

Our industry is booming, our roads are modernized, and our buildings are refurbished. It is now time to help the men, women, and children learn more about the world around them, and learn about the history of the Russian people. Dragunov has allowed us to use our investments in the state to build new statues, schools, museums and recreational centers for our people. The citizens of the Republic will no longer be painted as useless drones who only serve to manufacture weapons of war, we will let our society be known as one that balances business, and pleasure."

 UDM.1.t:0 "The Merchant State of Zlatoust"
 UDM.1.desc:0 "The history of Russia is one of blood, defeat, and destruction. Now, even as the remnants of the Motherland vie for scraps, millions live and die by the gun. The West is a prime example: It is a sea of fire, populated by warlords who place more value on dead ideologies than their own people. But there is hope.\n\nHigh atop the Urals stands Zlatoust, the last true bastion of freedom in old Russia. Behind these desolate mountains lie dozens of factories, spared from the Luftwaffe's rain of death. Petty bandits dare not risk scaling the Urals, lest they encounter the Republic's stout sentries. Refugees flock to Zlatoust by the hundreds, fleeing the wrath of madmen, who swim like sharks around the mountain home, eager to rip it apart at any moment.\n\nRumours speak of giant caves, filled to the brim with intact weaponry and heavy equipment, enough to give their owner the edge against any force in Siberia. Unfortunately, there are also those who try to divide the root of Zlatoust's unnatural prosperity. Indeed, for every bag of wheat and valuables traded into the mountains, there emerge trucks loaded with rifles, heading towards the domain of bandits. Zlatoust is a paradise built atop a mountain of corpses."

They shot at target dummies from a range of ~400 meters, and practiced hand-to-hand combat with one another in the evening.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this was not another roving band of mercenaries, as these soldiers exemplified discipline... but most importantly wielded modern weaponry.

For a moment, Jaba thought that a mocking smile flashed across the head merchant's face. He gazed at the mountain trucks, equipped to pass through any kind of blizzard, while he, the most successful bandit in all of Russia, had to arrive on a horse.\n\nThe merchants had brought out three dozen crates of rifles, bullets, and some combat knives for the chiefs. Jaba took one of the guns, an old AK-47: its barrel was battered, but could get the job done. He turned his head and nodded to the bandits. They grabbed the crates and carried them off, not unlike how a vulture feasts on the scraps left by a fierce predator. In turn, some footpads emerged from a nearby bush with heavy sacks across their shoulders. They deposited these into the mountain trucks, then disappeared back into the woods.\n\nThe head trader returned a dry smile, reached into his overcoat and produced a letter. Jaba took it, but before he could open the seal the merchants had already started their engines.\n\nThe head trader yelled out: 'Zlatoust appreciates this deal, and we hope that many more will follow.

Two dozen men emerged, armed with modern assault-rifles and sporting gas masks never before seen in Siberia.\n\n'We have come to see comrade Jaba!' yelled one of the soldiers as he flung the gun over his shoulder.\n\n'I'm Jaba.' The bandit shoved some footpads aside as he made his way through the mud. The meeting wasn't supposed to happen until next week, but Jaba found himself worried for the first time in many months.

Jaba looked at the end of the caravan, a hungry fire burned in his eye. He raised his hand and a pack of mules emerged from the foliage, loaded with sacks of grain. The head merchant raised his eyebrows and stared at the animals, then drew a heavy breath and looked back at Jaba.\n\nThe man from Zlatoust eyed Jaba and his compatriots as they handed off the grain. Now, in order to secure trust in the dealings between the Republic and the Yugrans, we must understand a level of complete trust. We would like the rest, please." the Merchant said.

He seemed to sing when he spoke, yet his voice somehow managed to maintain integrity and directness. Jaba could only listen as the man made outrageous demands in exchange for nearly trivial promises, but portrayed them in such a way that would make a king understand. However, the deal boiled down to this:\n\nThe bandits are a brave bunch, but lack the numbers to protect their territories (and loot) properly.

With the furious cry at the end of the call, the phone line was cut silent.\n\nDamnit. Another lost customer. Mayor-Consul Yevgeny Dragunov threw his chair back as it hit the ground with a solid thud, and ran over to the window of his office. Across the land, the Mayor-Consul looked over his hardworking people, toiling away in their businesses, earning a hefty profit from all the warring of the Russian lands. It was only by the good grace of God that they had not known of the four missed shipments, starving the regime of necessary funds. Truly, Zlatoust would not be known as "golden-mouthed" for much longer should a solution not be found quickly by Mayor-Consul Dragunov."

 zlatoust_sales.6.desc:0 "The burning wastes of a former storage house billowed with smoke against the white winter morning. Another group of bandits broken through the wall, with guns and bombs and bullets they so desperately needed, taking everything they could haul and burning it all behind them. Including the twelve guardsmen who stood to defend their homes, their wives, their families. "Put me on the line with Dragunov." Colonel Utkin said, steely, as the winter morning air puffed the words out in front of him.\n\n"Thirty rifles is what we ordered, Mayor-Consul Dragunov. Thirty. Rifles."\n\n"It was the grave error of several incompetent chains in the command of the businesses here in Zlatoust, Mr. Utkin, they've since been removed from their positions and we may continue our transacti-"\n\n"No fucking deal, Dragunov.

We've been waiting for months for these weapons, and you've doomed us in our wait. The men and women of Russia will hear about the fucking 'business' racket of Zlatoust, Mr. Dragunov!"\n\nIt was going to be a long night. Colonel Utkin knew it was no use to try and avoid the business deal with Dragunov, and that, eventually, his village was going to have to submit to Zlatoust's business venturian ways and make them sit, wait, and bleed. Now, all he could pray for was the day where Russians did not slaughter one another in the forest to come sooner."

 zlatoust_sales.7.desc:0 "Men shouted in the distance, retreating from the patch of trees and shrubbery handpicked by Colonel Utkin. That early morning, the few stars peaking through the rising sun's glare alongside the gentle falling snowflakes were not strong enough to pierce beauty through the grizzly sight of a blood-stained forest, as cloudy mists of Russian blood sprayed through the trees. There, deep within the Russian wilderness, Colonel Utkin found himself alive. His men, alive. And every single would-be marauder of his fine homestead and village on the run, or lying dead in the snow. Everyone stood silent, taking in their first victory in months, their first chance to make a stand against the Russian attacker who so greatly pillaged their lands for so long. The men threw down their rifles, hugged one another, and cheered to the heavens over their newfound victory against the murderous thieves who plagued them for so long. Colonel Utkin, however, took a minute to inspect the bodies. Boys, the least of which must have been sixteen. A prime age for cadets before the rise of the Soviets, perhaps, but the cold, lifeless eyes reminded him of that day when Russia would war no longer.\n\nCheers and cries greeted the party of guards as they entered their settlement once again, this time having tasted their first victory against the men who tore their land asunder for so long. However, whilst the rest of the men enjoyed family and the taverns, Colonel Utkin made his way up to his office, readying himself to congratulate the man truly in charge of their victory. Spinning the rotary, Colonel Utkin awaited.\n\n"Yes, Mayor-Consul Dragunov? This is Colonel Utkin. I wished to report the lives you saved with your most recent transaction with our government...""
