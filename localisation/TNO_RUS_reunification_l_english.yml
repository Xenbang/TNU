We could take advantage of this fact by covertly sending funds to groups that are sympathetic to our cause - and there are two ways about this. First, we can do this discreetly, only sending a minor amount of funds that would provide a mild boost in popularity. This has a very low chance of backfiring on us, and isn't going to be a major step forward, but something is better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could begin publicly endorsing pro-unification groups within [From.GetNameDef]. If this is successful, we could get a large boost of support. If not, this may work against us and cause relations to sour between our government and theirs. What decision shall we make?"

 russia_unification.152.d:0 "Another day passes where [GetOtherRegionalName] entices us into surrendering our sovereignty with honeyed words. This time, however, their offer seems almost gregarious: money enough, both in precious metals and rubles, to pay our men and generals for months! Though their diplomats' platitudes of unconditional generosity are as plain as ever... perhaps there is merit in heeding their words. Just this once."
 russia_unification.152.a:0 "We'll take their money with a smile."
 russia_unification.152.b:0 "[ROOT.GetName] is worth no ruble!"

 russia_unification.153.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Accepts Monetary Assistance!"
 russia_unification.153.d:0 "Our friends in [GetOtherRegionalName] have made the right choice by welcoming [ROOT.GetName]'s generous assistance to their finances. [FROM.GetLeader] wrote extensively on the wonders our money will fund: construction projects, better equipment, larger food supplies, and more. Already our hefty investment has borne fruit in the shape of goodwill; perhaps it won't be long now before they consider more permanent ties with us."
 russia_unification.153.a:0 "Their treasurers chose wisely."

 russia_unification.154.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Declines Monetary Assistance!"
 russia_unification.154.d:0 "The leaders of [GetOtherRegionalName] have made the idiotic choice of refusing our monetary assistance, decrying it as "bribery and distinctively un-Russian."" This is an affront to us, and relations between our two nations has decreased, with them hurling insults and stating that they "will not sell out Russia's freedom for honeyed words and petty cash.""
 russia_unification.154.a:0 "A shame."

 russia_unification.155.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Offers Resource Surplus!"
 russia_unification.155.d:0 "Another day passes where [GetOtherRegionalName] entices us into surrendering our sovereignty with honeyed words. This time, however, their offer seems almost gregarious: a glut of steel, chromium, tungsten, and more ores enough to feed our hungry factories until they themselves give! Though their diplomats' platitudes of unconditional generosity are as plain as ever... perhaps there is merit in heeding their words. Just this once."
 russia_unification.155.a:0 "Bring them into [ROOT.Capital.GetName] by the truckload!"

 russia_unification.156.d:0 "Our friends in [GetOtherRegionalName] have made the right choice by welcoming [ROOT.GetName]'s generous assistance to their factories' needs. The convoy we've sent remarked that [FROM.Capital.GetName]'s laborers unloaded their shipments in a matter of minutes, so eager were they to receive new materials at last. Already our hefty investment has borne fruit in the shape of goodwill; perhaps it won't be long now before they consider more permanent ties with us."
 russia_unification.156.a:0 "Their captains of industry chose wisely."

 russia_unification.157.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Declines Resource Surplus!"
 russia_unification.157.d:0 "Our offer of resources has come back as [GetOtherRegionalName] refuses it foolishly! In a lengthy statement to our emissaries and our government they have stated that they "need nothing of the sort from us" and that their factories need nothing as they are "richer in resources than we are in character." They have further stated they will "not be accepting our bribes," and our relationship has taken a large hit. We will remember their affront."

 russia_unification.158.d:0 "Another day passes where [GetOtherRegionalName] entices us into surrendering our sovereignty with honeyed words. This time, however, their offer seems almost gregarious: their finest scientists and engineers, with schemata and blueprints in tow! Though their diplomats' platitudes of unconditional generosity are as plain as ever... perhaps there is merit in heeding their words. Just this once."

Already our hefty investment has borne fruit in the shape of goodwill; perhaps it won't be long now before they consider more permanent ties with us."
 russia_unification.159.a:0 "Their scientists chose wisely."

 russia_unification.160.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Rejects Research Agreement!"
 russia_unification.160.d:0 "The rulers of [GetOtherRegionalName] have decided not to accept our generous offers of scientific research assistance. Perhaps they did not want to be reliant on a foreign power, or perhaps they suspect us of espionage. In either case, this leaves both of us weaker and more ignorant."
 russia_unification.160.a:0 "If they so wish to waste opportunities..."

Though their diplomats' platitudes of unconditional generosity are as plain as ever... perhaps there is merit in heeding their words. Just this once."

 russia_unification.162.d:0 "Our friends in [GetOtherRegionalName] have made the right choice by welcoming [ROOT.GetName]'s generous promises to their leadership's futures. [FROM.GetLeader]'s last letter to [ROOT.GetLeader], for instance, looked and sounded like a winding, heartwarming epistle from a long-lost friend. Already our hefty investment has borne fruit in the shape of goodwill; perhaps it won't be long now before they consider more permanent ties with us."
 russia_unification.162.a:0 "Our new best friends chose wisely."

 russia_unification.163.t:0 "[GetOtherRegionalName] Declines Cabinet Positions!"
 russia_unification.163.d:0 "Ultimately, our counterparts in [GetOtherRegionalName] refused to take our offer of ministerial positions.

 russia_unification.164.d:0 "Thankfully, our great nation here in [ROOT.GetName] has endured the trials necessary to succeed in the broken state of Russia today. However, while it may be broken, it doesn't have to stay that way, and blood isn't necessary to achieve unification. Thankfully, we have prepared an invitation to the government of [GetOtherRegionalName] to a preliminary conference on the topic of the unification of our states. With all our hopes and desires, a united Russia may be possible yet."
 russia_unification.164.a:0 "May the odds be in Russia's favor!"

 russia_unification.165.t:0 "Foundations of the Conference"
 russia_unification.165.d:0 "With their rightful invitation to our halls for a Conference regarding the beginnings of governmental unification, the government of [GetOtherRegionalName] must be swayed enough to work in our favor to accept this. Thus, it is our top priority to prepare every speech, every legal parchment, every political discussion topic. The unification of the Russian nation may rely on the success of this conference."
 russia_unification.165.a:0 "Prepare, prepare, prepare!"

 russia_unification.166.t:0 "Checking the Air in the Room"
 russia_unification.166.d:0 "If we seek for the successfully peaceful unification between the people of [GetOtherRegionalName] and ourselves, then we must keep a watchful eye on how things are faring between each of our governments. Should things look well, then our plans shall be well ready to be set in motion; however, if there are rising tensions between our states..."
 russia_unification.166.a:0 "We must rally the Russians!"
 russia_unification.166.b:0 "This could be a viable course."
 russia_unification.166.c:0 "We must prioritize our sovereignty."

 russia_unification.167.t:0 "With Welcome Applause"
 russia_unification.167.d:0 "With recent incoming transmissions from the state of [GetOtherRegionalName], it appears as though their government is more than willing to enter into the preliminary conferences we have organized. For their sake, our sake, and the sake of all Russians, may we hope that we can find a way towards unification and greatness for all of Russia!"
 russia_unification.167.a:0 "A conference with great hopes!"

 russia_unification.168.t:0 "Concessions and Cooperation"
 russia_unification.168.d:0 "In our efforts to bring about the greatness of a Russian future, the Preliminary Conference we've organized with [GetOtherRegionalName] on the topic of unification has resulted in a success of mixed results. It is absolutely true that they've authorized the unification of our states; however, with some amount of concessions having to be made by the end of it, some politicians or leaders may end up dissatisfied. However, knowing that Russia is one more step to unification is worth all of the worries."
 russia_unification.168.a:0 "Mixed results and shaking hands!"

 russia_unification.169.t:0 "Measured Rejection"
 russia_unification.169.d:0 "Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that a disappointing transmission has come across our most recent reports. In extended detail, the government of [GetOtherRegionalName] has quietly stated a list of reasons by which they have stated an inability to attend the Conference we have set up regarding the unification of our states, most of all their hesitance to surrender [GetOtherRegionalName]'s autonomy. This presents a significant issue in regards to our potential for a peaceful unification of Russians of the land, and sends a wave of unpreparedness and worry over the potentially deadly future of our time."
 russia_unification.169.a:0 "Only the future knows."

 russia_unification.170.t:0 "The Unification Conference"
 russia_unification.170.d:0 "Today, it has been announced that the state of [GetOtherRegionalName] has wholeheartedly signed into the concordance of a state of unity with the government of [ROOT.GetName], promising a peaceful and unified future for the Russian nation. Victory shall be ours in our great work towards promising a better and brighter future for the people of Russia!"

 russia_unification.171.t:0 "Disaster on the Home Front"
 russia_unification.171.d:0 "It comes with a certain degree of shame, worry, and dishonor that we have to report the failure of the preliminary conferences with the government of [GetOtherRegionalName] and our representatives. Not only does this provide for a cloud of worry to cast over the Russian people this day, in fear of the bloodsoaked past recurring once again. Furthermore, the failure of the conference has provided for great disappointment amongst the leadership of our government, and has effectively caused a great deal of stress upon our government."
 russia_unification.171.a:0 "Dreams of a united Russia, now faded slightly."

 russia_unification.172.t:0 "May Our Work Be Fruitful"
 russia_unification.172.d:0 "It is officially time for the Conference we have prepared for so diligently between our government and the leadership of [GetOtherRegionalName]. The future is frightening, anxiety-inducing, enthralling, and exciting all at once. Yes, it is quite terribly filled with the unknown, but through this unknown, we must find hope, confidence, and a light at the end of the tunnel for this battered Russian people."
 russia_unification.172.a:0 "To hope, to Russia!"
 russia_unification.172.b:0 "We shall reject their honeyed lies once and for all!"

 russia_unification.173.t:0 "After So Long..."
 russia_unification.173.d:0 "Our diplomats leave the conference with their new compatriots in tow and a treaty declaring the [GetOtherRegionalName]'s integration into the [ROOT.GetName]. These two nations, already so intertwined with each other's economy, military and politics, have formalized their unity by sharing a banner and name. Though work in adapting the [GetOtherRegionalName]'s laws and administration remains, our union can no longer be interfered with or interrupted by other, ill-intentioned nations.\n\nSo ends in peace Russia's half-century of national humiliation."
 russia_unification.173.a:0 "And so begins a hundred years of rebirth."

 russia_unification.174.t:0 "...And Still Not Enough"
 russia_unification.174.d:0 "The first day ended with shouting and bleeding, broken fists.\n\nThe second day ended with lead-riddled corpses haystrewn in and outside of the conference hall.\n\nWe never bothered attending the third. Reportedly, neither did they."
