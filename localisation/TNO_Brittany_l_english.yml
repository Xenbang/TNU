 #Leader Descriptions
 
 POLITICS_OLIER_MORDREL_DESC:0 "To say Brittany's relationship with the Pakt is... complicated, is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one can possibly make about the Reich's little entente. Originally named an autonomous zone of France, Mordrel found himself continuously annoyed by the fact that years on from the war the Bretons were still forced under French yoke.\n\nWhen the Reich forcefully tore what is now Burgundy away from France, Mordrel saw his chance. Proposing that a free Brittany, loyal to the Reich in all ways, would be far more useful to the Reich than the now decrepit French state. Within weeks of the formation of Burgundy, Brittany was declared independent as well in a conference attended by thirty nations. None of which were France.\n\nWhen the Reich tumbled into destitution in the 50s however, Mordrel reluctantly decided to begin importing food from abroad despite the embargo between the United States and Germany. Illegally smuggling in goods to keep Brittany afloat, the Bretons soon realized the value of selling the food to the starving and needy of the Reich. This situation only expanded, for as the Black Market expanded, Germany became more and more powerless to stop it and more and more reliant on its goods.\n\nNow, a decade later, Brittany stands as the staple port for illegal goods crossing into the Reich with Mordrel as its kingpin. While he has never professed any love for the Reich, they have so far kept the black legions of Himmler out of his affairs, and the pipeline of food, media, and much more illicit goods have certainly made Brittany as strong as he had once dreamed, even if the methods were a tad unexpected..."
 POLITICS_RAYMOND_DELAPORTE_DESC:0 "While Mordrel, Delaporte and Lainé were once brothers in arms and founders of the Breton National Committee, time has a way of causing all things to crumble. Time brought the Reich low, time ended the old order of Europe, and time too ended a partnership that saw Brittany rise from a forgotten footnote in history to the first European state to achieve its independence since the Second World War.\n\nThe true destruction of the friendship arose from the increasing differences in ideology, even while Brittany prospered and expanded. Mordrel became increasingly obsessed with his illegal trading, believing it to be the only way to a strong Brittany, and had become convinced that he could somehow play the various powers of the world against one another for the Breton good. Lainé had become disgusted with what he saw as Brittany growing weaker by the day and his two companions were increasingly worried by his growing hardline stances and the rapid militarization of the Bezen Perrot.\n\nDelaporte, however, saw his path in the opposite direction. An intellectual, he believed that democratic values and a denouncement of extremist sentiments would be the only possibility for a lasting Breton state. The abomination that is the Black Market had to be killed, and responsibility had to be taken for the horrors Brittany sold to the world, and the Bezen Perrot had to be shut down as the final step towards true freedom. Delaporte's denouncement of the Perrot was seen as a shock to the others, and his increasing declarations that liberty would need to spread to Brittany finished the deal.\n\nDelaporte cares little about whether these virtues will improve the world, but they will improve Brittany. Can any true patriot wish for anything else?"
 POLITICS_CELESTIN_LAINE_DESC:0 "Boots marching across Europe, tanks rolling over the ancient regimes and a single strong leader ruling over it all. The Reich showed the world true strength when it trampled upon its enemies and it inspired in Lainé the true strength that a strong and spirited military and a stronger leader could provide.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war and even more rapidly after independence was achieved, Lainé militarized the Bezen Perrot into his own personal force of stormtroopers, in every way modelled after the German SS. Seeing strong ties to the Reich and especially Burgundy as a necessity to maintain Breton strength, Lainé has numerous times called for Brittany to select the customers of the Black Market more carefully, and even declare itself a 'brother state' of Burgundy.\n\nAs he has increasingly radicalized over the years and his group of militants have increasingly turned into a private army, Lainé and his two former companions-Delaporte and Mordrel-have fallen increasingly apart. Whether it is Mordrel and his constant degenerate actions that actively harm Brittany's greatest allies or Delaporte's treasonous assinuations that Brittany should abandon the very ideals that gave it life, his two former friend's downfall was long foretold.\n\nWith his old companionships broken, Lainé let his tears be shed in private before marching out and preparing his men for the final step in Brittany's greatness. So what if friends will betray a man and old comrades leave him in the dust? Hitler himself was once nothing besides a struggling pauper. Lainé too will show the world what he is capable of, he will show his former 'friends' the insanity of their beliefs, and he will show Brittany that only he can keep her safe."
 POLITICS_GOULVEN_PENNAOD_DESC:0 "Born in 1928 and originally known by his French name Georges Pinault, Brittany has always been close to Goulven Pennaod's heart. A Breton nationalist from a young age, for a long time Pennaod's life revolved around the cause for Breton independence. Being too young to take part in the war efforts during the Second World War, he instead joined one of the many youth movements connected to Breton nationalist groups, and served with distinction.\n\nPennaod's claim to fame arose after the war, as he joined the armed forces of the newly established Breton state. With practiced skills he became the bane of French partisans seeking refuge and hideouts in Brittany, ensuring the continued stability of Brittany. In 1960, his efforts were recognized as he became the youngest general in the equally young Breton army.\n\nDespite the large influence Bezen Perrot held in the army, Pennaod never felt compelled to join the group, seeing his first and only duty being towards Brittany herself. In time, and especially after his promotion to general, this stubborness created friction between him (And his fellow non-BP officers) and the officers loyal to Lainé.\n\nAs the foremost officer still loyal to Brittany, it fell unto Pennaod to secure the state after Delaporte's revolution. But despite his good intentions, Delaporte bit more than he could chew, and risked the wrath of the Burgundians by flirting with the leftists. Pennaod and the Military Clique had to step in, to save Brittany from herself.\n\nNow in charge of the young democracy, it remains to be seen if Pennaod will succeed where Delaporte failed."
 POLITICS_YANN_FOUERE_DESC:0 "Jean Adolphe Fouéré was born in Aignan, southern France, on the 26th of July, 1910. From a young age, he would come to know firsthand the oppression of the Bretons under French rule, as Breton culture was suppressed in public life around him. In time, Yann Fouéré came to despise the situation, and effectively turned to Breton nationalism.\n\nHaving served a distinguished career in various Breton newspapers, Fouéré was also active in Breton politics. While a Breton at heart, he became a supporter of federalism as laid out by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and has been advocating for it in his numerous newspaper articles. For a long time, there were merely his own musings, as necessity demanded an alliance of all democrats in Brittany, and for all to look past their differences in order to guarantee the success of the revolution. Now, things have changed.\n\nAfter taking control of the so-called Moderate Wing of the SAV, Fouéré was free to spread his federalist ideas to his comrades. And as evidenced by his election of the president of Brittany, his ideas had struck a chord.\n\nWith the way clear, Fouéré is free to chase his dreams. While not yet announced, he has been crafting a theory of a federalist Europe, where Europe is redrawn according to regional borders, forming ethnically homogenous states. These states would then from a pan-European federation of nations, an Europe of a 100 flags.\n\nIt remains to be seen if such radical ideas will strike the same chord among his supporters as his previous ideas."

 BRTflav.1.desc:0 "The family of Morvan Marchal has announced that the famous Breton nationalist has passed away. Best known for designing the \"Gwenn-ha-du\", or the flag of Brittany, the national treasure passed away due to natural causes at the ripe old age of 63. The nation mourns, and streets across Brittany are covered in the black and white of the national flag.\n\nA state funeral is being planned for the national hero."

 BRTflav.2.desc:0 "Morvan Marchal's funeral was held today at the cemetary near his birth place of Gwitreg. In addition to his family, characters from the political life of Brittany attended the funeral, most notably Olier Mordrel and Célestin Lainé. While Raymond Delaporte shined with his absence, he did send a letter to honor the recently deceased. Mordrel and Lainé held short speeches as well, mostly focused on Marchal's achievements in life and legacy in death.\n\nAfter the casket was covered in the black and white flag of Brittany, and Marchal was lowered to his final resting place, the funeral was over. But as Mordrel, Lainé and Delaporte had all reminded the good people present, life must now go on."

 BRTflav.3.t:0 "20th Anniversary"
 BRTflav.3.desc:0 "On the 12th of December, 1943, abbot Yann Vari Perrot, a famed Breton nationalist, was murdered by a bolshevik assassin. Soon after this cowardly attack towards the very core of Brittany, on the 15th of December, the Bezen Perrot was bestowed with its current name, in place of the earlier name, Bezen Kadoudal. The assassin was caught and brought to swift justice.\n\nThe days between the 12th and 15th have turned into annual celebrations of Breton independence, where the Bezen Perrot have a central ceremonial role. The 20th anniversary is to be the largest of these celebrations yet, with everything from local festivals to official events being planned months, if not years in advance."

 BRTpostwar.2.desc:0 "The annexations of Loire and Western Normandy by our brave armies did not come without surprises. While we were advancing from the west, the Burgundians were doing likewise from the east, and for understandable reasons, the French civilians chose to flee towards us.\n\nAs the dust has settled, we have discovered countless French refugees within our new territories. However, since they did not technically flee into Brittany, their legal status is unclear.\n\nFurthermore, Loire and Western Normandy are currently under military occupation.

The cabinet has come up with three solutions: Firstly, we may wish to invest funds into supporting the refugees before and after release, in order to assure that the sudden influx of people does not destabilize the country. Secondly, we could simply let them go, as they will have no problem in assimilating to the newly annexed territories. Naturally we'll have to provide a nominal amount of funds to support them.

 brtblack.1.desc:0 "The Black Market refers to the institutionally conducted peddling of weapons, contraband and everything else by the Breton state. Born out of a necessity during the 1950's, the system continued to live on past the crisis that gave it birth. Today, the Breton Black Market is a public secret, and doing business in the most unlikely locations imaginable.\n\nHowever, the scale of the business has always been on the smaller side. As 1962 begins, that's about to change. With plans of global Black Market hegemony, Olier Mordrel has set out to grow the Black Market's reach all around the world. This is where you come in.\n\nAs the player, your objective is to create a Black Market that could raise Brittany into a world power. To do this, you will need to think strategically, stay on top of world events, and avoid investing on the losing side (Unless prolonging the conflict is your goal, in which case, good thinking.). The guides found within this decision category will give you a basic idea as to how the Black Market works. Good luck."

 brtblack.5.desc:0 "To purchase weaponry from foreign countries, three conditions must be met. One, you must have Black Market Arms Trading operations within the country (Just a network won't do). Two, the target country must have ten or more military factories. And three, the target country must have the technology relevant to what you are buying (If they have not researched attack helicopters, you can't buy attack helicopters from them either).\n\nFor a detailed list of what you will exactly receive upon purchase, examine the descriptions/tooltips found by hovering over the relevant decision. To simplify, higher presence means more equipment and smaller costs.\n\nThe type of equipment you receive depends on the technological level of the target country.\n\nLuxury goods work a little differently. For every nation with a Luxury Trading operation in it, you have a monthly chance of gaining goods. With Light presence, the chance is 25%, with Moderate, 35%, and with Substantial, 45%. These goods will then be stockpiled ready for sale, you can see your current stockpile in the luxury trading category."

And three, the target country must have less than 50% stability.\n\nExpanding Black Market presence costs money, and you can find a detailed breakdown of the calculations by hovering over the decision and inspecting the description/tooltip.

From the start of the game, this happens by completing relevant focuses on the Black Market section of the focus tree. However, after completing the focus Unlimited Market Potential, a new decision category will unlock, allowing you to independently expand the network to nations where it does not yet exist.\n\nTry as they might, whereas Black Market presence can be removed by foreign nations, the network can never be truly undone, not unless we say so."

Relations will eventually return to normal, allowing further trading.\n\nLuxury goods can be sold to any country with Luxury Trading operations. Unlike military equipment sales, these sales are completed among the less reputable citizens of the target country, and as such will have a chance of failing. The risk of a shipment being caught increases with larger shipments, however larger shipments are also more profitable. Consider the risk-benefit ratio before committing. On that note, when increasing Luxury Trading operations, consider the fact that every increase of Luxury Trading operations necessitates the increasing of luxury good shipments; You can't sell small shipments to a nation with Substantial Luxury Trading operations, for instance."

 BRT.3.t:0 "The Hole In the Curtain"
 BRT.3.desc:0 "The famed iron curtain of Europe has stood strong ever since the glorious victory of the German Reich in the Second World War. A mutual embargo between the OFN and the Unity-Pakt has existed for decades at this point. This policy of economic and cultural exclusion between the two major factions has been devastating for trade, as Western goods are now practically unobtainable across the entirety of the Pakt. But where there is demand, supply must follow, and Brittany is in an exceptional position to profit from this uncomfortable situation. If people want Western goods, who are we to refuse, as long as the proper payment is given of course."
 BRT.3.a:0 "All in the name of free trade."
 BRT.5.t:0 "Franco-Burgundian War"
 BRT.5.desc:0 "While Germany is busy with fighting itself, Himmler and the Burgundians have taken the opportunity to invade the already weakened French. While not exactly a surprising move, there is something we could do that few would see coming; Invade France.\n\nThe French armed forces are a joke, and whatever they do have will be fully occupied with their desperate defense against Burgundy. While our standing army is not of great size, we could easily overrun whatever resistance the French manage to muster against us. Should we be successful in our invasion, we stand to gain a good portion of Normandy and the entirety of Loire."
 BRT.5.a:0 "For once, it's the Bretons marching into France, not the other way around."
 BRT.5.b:0 "It's too risky, who knows how Burgundy would react. Stand down."
 BRT.7.t:0 "Germany in Flames"
 BRT.7.desc:0 "The tensions in Germany have reached a boiling point, with each of the potential contenders for the leader of Germany declaring himself the rightful heir of Hitler. Hostilities soon started between the various factions, and when the news reached Brittany, champagne bottles were opened and celebrations began. War is good for business, and a civil war in Germany looked to be mighty profitable indeed. While the overall business strategy for the German civil war has yet to be decided, everyone in Brittany can agree that good times were ahead for the small nation."
 BRT.7.a:0 "Get the cigars!"
 BRT.8.t:0 "Taking A Side"
 BRT.8.desc:0 "While selling to every participant in the German civil war might be profitable, it would also leave us in a rather uncomfortable situation once the war ends. By supporting a single candidate we can assure good relations after the war, assuming they survive of course. Better to put all our eggs in one basket than risk an angry German stomping on them. All that remains is to pick which contender we will support."
 BRT.8.a:0 "Speer seems like a good bet." 
 BRT.8.b:0 "Perhaps supporting Heydrich will spare us his wrath later." 
 BRT.8.c:0 "Bormann can ensure that business goes on as usual." 
 BRT.8.d:0 "Göring looks to be a very profitable customer."
 BRT.9.t:0 "Support from Brittany"
 BRT.9.desc:0 "Great news! The brave merchants of Brittany have realized that we are the true successors to Germany. Breton smugglers have long aided us in educating the students of Germany, and it is only natural that they aid us further in our struggle against the traitors. The Bretons are willing to help us distribute our propaganda across Germany using their many networks in the Reich, as well as providing us with weapons and equipment for our army!"
 BRT.9.a:0 "For liberty!"
 BRT.10.t:0 "Support from Brittany" 
 BRT.10.desc:0 "The Bretons have long been a loyal member of the Unity-Pakt, and unlike many of our treacherous former "allies", they have seen that Bormann is the true heir of Hitler. Accordingly, they have declared their support for both the party and the Führer to us in private. We can soon expect support to come flowing in form the Breton markets across Europe, as well as a loyal base from which we can contact the wider world."
 BRT.10.a:0 "For stability!"
 BRT.11.t:0 "Support from Brittany" 
 BRT.11.desc:0 "Fantastic news! The Breton smugglers have seen that we are the righteous heirs of Hitler's legacy, and as such have started to support our brave troops in their struggle against the traitors that occupy our fatherland. Soon bombs and weapons will flow from Brittany, straight into the hands of our courageous soldiers on the front. This will surely aid us in the war!"
 BRT.11.a:0 "For strength!"
 BRT.12.t:0 "Support from Brittany"
 BRT.12.desc:0 "In a rather strange move, the degenerate smugglers and thieves of Brittany have decided to support us in the civil war. The Bretons are the primary vector from which the infection of western "culture" comes from, corrupting the majority of the German youth. Perhaps this is some foolish endeavor to delay their fate after our inevitable victory. No matter, they will receive just punishment for their crimes at the hand of Burgundy soon enough."
 BRT.12.a:0 "The fools seek to save themselves."
 BRT.13.t:0 "The Merchants of Europe"
 BRT.13.desc:0 "While Brittany has long been a part of France, the fires of Breton nationalism could never be quenched completely. And with the fall of France in the second world war, an opportunity presented itself for the Bretons. Through shrewd diplomacy and negotiations, the independence of Brittany was secured, on the condition that they join the German lead Unity-Pakt. But Brittany cares little for the ideological war between the superpowers of the world, preferring more material rewards for their labors. Brittany is the heart of an ever-expanding system of black markets and smugglers. Guns, books, and people flow through Brittany, and the new order looks to be a very profitable one indeed."
 BRT.13.a:0 "To a profitable year!" 
 BRT.14.t:0 "Delaporte Takes Over"
 BRT.14.desc:0 "As things calmed, plans that had been in the making for years were set into motion. The cabinet was replaced, with Yann Fouéré as the first among equals, and as its first act, the new government ratified Delaporte's presidency. A new constitution was to be written, a new defense force had to be established to replace the Bezen Perrot, and international diplomacy had to be conducted to survive in this most dangerous of ages. All in due time.\n\nFor now, at least, it would seem Raymond's revolution was a complete success."
 BRT.14.a:0 "Freedom!" 
 BRT.15.t:0 "Lainé Takes Over"
 BRT.15.desc:0 "The Bezen Perrot unit tasked with eliminating Mordrel found their work had been finished before they even arrived at Mordrel's residence. As they arrived, a crowd had formed in front of the building, with police and hospital vehicles parked in front. As the captain in charge made his way inside, he was informed that Mordrel has committed suicide approximately an hour earlier.\n\nIt seems the news of the ongoing purge had reached Mordrel, and seeing no other way out of the situation, he had deemed it appropriate to deny his enemies the satisfaction of killing him. Regardless, the operation to cleanse Brittany has been completed. As the Bezen Perrot reformed and marched towards the halls of governance, Lainé marched at the head of the column, in a clear attempt to emulate other leaders of the recent past.\n\nThe sight at the top of the stairs leading into the building was awe-inspiring; Thousands of Bezen Perrot troopers stood in formation, waiting for Lainé to proclaim the end of the old Brittany, and the birth of a new, stronger Brittany."
 BRT.15.a:0 "Dav warnehe!" 
 BRT.17.t:0 "Brittany Declares Neutrality"
 BRT.17.desc:0 "Perhaps to the surprise of no one, the Bretons have seen fit to stay out of the civil war. Rather, it would be more accurate to say that the state of Brittany has chosen not to endorse any one side during the conflict. After all, in the matter of weeks the first reports of crates bearing the ermine seal were received.\n\nThough Brittany won't participate in the war, they are very much involved. The black market will serve not only us, but our enemies as well; We should keep this in mind after we've won."
 BRT.17.a:0 "Their greed will be their downfall." 
 BRT.18.t:0 "Crossroad"
 BRT.18.desc:0 "With the civil war in Germany already raging at full force, we must decide how to approach the situation. All sides of the war are expecting us to declare loyalty to them, and send support for the war effort. However, whispers among the Pakt suggest that numerous parts of the Reich are remaining outside of the war, and some are planning to distance themselves from the Germans altogether. This war might be just the excuse we've been waiting for to cut ties.\n\nShould we begin preparations to declare loyalty to one of the participants, or should we take this chance to further distance ourselves from the Germans?"
 BRT.18.a:0 "We owe them too much to betray them now." 
 BRT.18.b:0 "We owe them nothing! Breiz d'ar Vreiziz!"
 BRT.19.t:0 "Armed Forces Expansion"
 BRT.19.desc:0 "As we work towards a stable nation, we must prepare to defend said nation. Our current armed forces have been sufficient as we've had the protection of the Pakt, but in the future we may need to fight alone. Question is, should our armed forces focus on well trained, less numerous troops, or should we bolster our ranks as much as possible?"
 BRT.19.a:0 "Quality over quantity." 
 BRT.19.b:0 "Quantity has a quality all its own."
 BRT.20.t:0 "The Ermine Seal"
 BRT.20.desc:0 "The ermine, a heraldic symbol, has been the symbol of Brittany since medieval times. In more recent times, the symbol has also been associated with illegal shipments originating from Brittany. The stamp, found on boxes, crates, containers and other instruments of transportation, is known to mark the high quality of the contents within."
 BRT.20.a:0 "Customer satisfaction guaranteed." 
 BRT.21.t:0 "Farewell"
 BRT.21.desc:0 "The sound of champagne bottles bursting open formed the soundtrack of this historical event; A series of letters formally informing the various German leaders that Brittany no longer has any role within the Pakt, and has no interest in taking a part in the Pakt either. Brittany is now completely free of the perfidious Hun's exploitation, and a glorious future awaits the liberated Bretons!"
 BRT.21.a:0 "At long last!" 
 BRT.22.t:0 "Brittany Cuts Ties"
 BRT.22.desc:0 "Breton diplomats dispatched from Brest have made contact with our foreign office. Coming as no great surprise, the diplomats have informed us that effective immediately, Brittany considers our \"master-servant relationship\", as they put it, as null and void. Furthermore, Brittany will declare its independence to the world post-haste.\n\nSuch confrontational rhetoric is hardly expected of Bretons when addressing Germany, and as it happens, the diplomats quickly began calming the situation. As a personal guarantee from Mordrel, Brittany has promised to stay out of our way with a guarantee of neutrality."
 BRT.22.a:0 "As if they could afford anything less."
 BRT.23.t:0 "Brest Calling"
 BRT.23.desc:0 "From the general chaos of the former Pakt, a message from Brest has reached us. The Breton republic informs us that they have broken free of German rule, and among their first tasks as a free nation, they have chosen to contact a number of leading world powers. The broadcasts are considered as mere declarations of independence for the international community, not as demands for the recognition of independence for Brittany.\n\nDespite the chaotic situation in Germany, it remains to be seen if the Bretons can hold on to their newfound freedom."
 BRT.23.a:0 "Congratulations, I suppose?"
 BRT.24.t:0 "Brittany Calling"
 BRT.24.desc:0 "Like so many other nations, Brittany too broke away from our alliance as soon as news of the civil war had been confirmed. And like so many others, they too have come crawling back, realizing that we are their only hope of survival in the world.\n\nHowever, the Bretons have made it clear that they do not intend to return into a master-servant relationship, and are only interested in re-establishing diplomatic contact with us as a free and independent nation."
 BRT.24.a:0 "Not surprising." 
 BRT.25.t:0 "Shipment from Brittany"
 BRT.25.desc:0 "Containers marked with the familiar ermine seal arrived at one of our supply depots today. Inside, vast amounts of crates filled with weapons of war. As a gesture of friendship, the shipment has been provided free of charge."
 BRT.25.a:0 "The first crate is on the house." 
 BRT.26.t:0 "Breton Observers"
 BRT.26.desc:0 "In their efforts to help our cause, the Bretons have sent a detachment to \"observe\" the ongoing conflict. In practice, this detachment will be responsible for streamlining various aspects of our operations in the rear, which will lead to improved combat effectiveness on the frontlines."
 BRT.26.a:0 "Don't think this will save you." 
 BRT.27.t:0 "Service from Brest"
 BRT.27.desc:0 "In their efforts to help our cause, the Bretons have opened the port of Brest for our purposes. Having a reliable safe haven outside the warzone will be an immense help."
 BRT.27.a:0 "The goods must flow." 
 BRT.28.t:0 "Support from Brittany"

 BRT.29.t:0 "Planes from Brittany"
 BRT.29.desc:0 "A minor case of panic broke out today in one of our airports, as multiple squadrons of jet planes appeared out of thin air, beelining towards the airport. Luckily, the planes turned out to be manned by Breton pilots, only here to delived their planes for our war effort."
 BRT.29.a:0 "Thankfully they were not hostile planes." 
 BRT.30.t:0 "Believers from Brittany"
 BRT.30.desc:0 "In their efforts to help our cause, the Bretons have sent a small group of experts to help us in our propaganda efforts. Believers in the cause to a man and woman, the group will use their black market contacts to spread our propaganda among the enemy populace, weakening their resolve and strengthening ours."
 BRT.30.a:0 "I thought all they cared about was money." 
 BRT.31.t:0 "Mysterious Leaflets"
 BRT.31.desc:0 "Numerous reports have arrived to the HQ, all speaking of the same oddity; All around our cities, numerous Speerian propaganda leaflets have been found. Having seemingly appeared out of nowhere, it's now too late for us to counter these falsehoods. We shall have to re-evaluate Speer's capabilities regarding propaganda."
 BRT.31.a:0 "...I smell Breton involvement."
 BRT.32.t:0 "With Friends Like These..."
 BRT.32.desc:0 "Out of the original founding of the Breton National Committee, three friends would emerge as the central figures of Breton politics. Olier Mordrel, Raymond Delaporte and Célestin Lainé would form a powerful trio orchestrating the eventual independence of Brittany. However, as time went on, the three came to have different understandings of what was best for Brittany.\n\nMordrel has been in control of Brittany ever since its formal independence, and the infamous black market was largely spearheaded by him and his supporters. Meanwhile, Lainé has been making sure the Bezen Perrot keeps growing stronger by the day, and in his position as the paramilitary's leader he has kept Brittany secure. Lastly, Delaporte has been responsible for keeping the Breton National Committee in line, making sure that pandemonium does not break out and laws are smoothly passed.\n\nThe ideological differences between the three have finally reached a boiling point; The first one to take action is likely to emerge victorious, and have the chance to guide Brittany towards a future they see fit."
 BRT.32.a:0 "...Who needs enemies?"
 BRT.33.t:0 "The Champion of Democracy"
 BRT.33.desc:0 "Little did Mordrel know, but the forces of democracy form a silent majority among the Breton people. Delaporte on the other hand knows this very well. As Mordrel continues down the path of nepotism and corruption, and Lainé shows no signs of seeing sense, it's high time to take action.\n\nThe plan is simple; First, the head of the snake that is fascism, Mordrel, can be taken out of the picture by the simple act of bribery; Our man in the government, Yann Fouéré, should be able to take care of this. Secondly, with the support of those not under Lainé's boot, the Bezen Perrot can be sidelined completely by eliminating their chain of command. Namely, the promising young general, Goulven Pennaod, will be instrumental in this.\n\nIt's sure to be a risky campaign, but no price is too high to achieve democracy. And Delaporte is not alone in thinking this."
 BRT.33.a:0 "The Breton people stand with Raymond."
 BRT.34.t:0 "The Right Price"
 BRT.34.desc:0 "As the cabinet was dismissed after a typically short meeting of fifteen minutes, Fouéré remained seated as the rest left the room. Mordrel, still busy with signing some paperwork of dubious value, soon realized he was not alone. As they met each others eyes, Fouéré rose from his seat.\n\nAs he walked over to Mordrel, he produced a sealed letter from his jacket. Without exchanging a single word, he slammed the letter with slightly more force than intended onto Mordrel's desk. A few tense seconds of staring at each other passed, until Fouéré finally excused himself and left.\n\nSlightly puzzled by the theatrics, Mordrel nevertheless wasted no time in opening the letter. As he poured the contents on the desk, the fluttering of paper was accompanied by the clang of metal. A key. And more importantly, the note, which congratulated Mordrel on his immediate retirement, and informed him that the key would open a safe in a secure location, containing 50.000.000 dollars."
 BRT.34.a:0 "...I never liked this governing thing anyway."
 BRT.35.t:0 "Lainé's Downfall"
 BRT.35.desc:0 "Goulven Pennaod, escorted by a number of his men, practically crashed inside Delaporte's headquarters. In addition to grime and bruises, something of a smile covered all their faces. Soon, Delaporte and friends were smiling as well.\n\nEarlier that day, at the crack of dawn, Pennaod and soldiers loyal to him all around Brittany had assaulted key locations of the Bezen Perrot. The operations had gone smoothly, as the paramilitaries were not prepared for such an aggressive move, though both sides took a few casualties as the more fanatic elements realized what was going on.\n\nRegardless, all major players of the Bezen Perrot are now in custody, including Lainé himself, who was captured en route to a barracks in Brest. It remains to be seen whether the now leaderless Bezen Perrot will manage to mount a defense when we launch our final operation to take over the government proper."
 BRT.35.a:0 "Excellent work."
 BRT.36.t:0 "Dawn of the Revolution"
 BRT.36.desc:0 "Lainé has always been a man of action. This trait is what places him above the likes of Mordrel and Delaporte. While those two have been scheming in the shadows, Lainé has been preparing for the eventuality of internal conflict for years. And now, it's finally time to put the preparations to use.\n\nIn order to secure the state from forces aiming for its ruin, the ruling government must be neutralized. Most of all, Mordrel himself must be eliminated for good. Additionally, Delaporte and his fellow fools must be prevented from taking advantage of the chaos that will inevitably erupt.\n\nFor a long time, members of the Bezen Perrot have been waiting for the day when Brittany calls upon them to defend herself. The clock is ticking."
 BRT.36.a:0 "It's almost midnight."
 BRT.37.t:0 "The Conference"
 BRT.37.desc:0 "As Lainé sat down, the rest of the general staff followed suit. While Yann Goulet and Alan Heusaff, loyal members of the Bezen Perrot, seemed calm, they were well aware that this meeting might end in blood. Louis Feutren and Goulven Pennaod, the youngest members of the general staff and known only for their loyalty towards Brittany, similarily had some notion as to the purpose of the meeting.\n\nAs Lainé proceeded to bring everyone up to date on the plans of the Bezen Perrot, Feutren and Pennaod remained silent. Their stern faces betrayed no signs of worry or panic. As Lainé finished his speech, explaining how and when Mordrel was to die, a silence fell over the room.\n\nWith all eyes of the room on the two young generals, Lainé stood up. The soon-to-be-free nation of Brittany..."

 BRT.38.t:0 "Budget Cuts"
 BRT.38.desc:0 "A little known fact is that the Bezen Perrot depends on government grants to function at the size it does. Both Mordrel and Lainé are of course very well aware of this. Calling the dismantling of the Bezen Perrot a \"purge\" is merely dramatic flavour, as the organization began crumbling as soon as funding was cut.\n\nIt wouldn't take long for membership to fall down to appropriate levels, but Lainé's position as the Security Minister was a whole other problem. As there was seemingly no reason to fire him, a deal was struck in order to have him step down peacefully. In exchange for not outlawing the Bezen Perrot completely, Lainé would let his fellow officer of the general staff, Goulven Pennaod, a man of known loyalty to Brittany, to take his place.\n\nIn the end, the era of the Bezen Perrot dominating military affairs within the nation was all but over, and their downfall was mirrored in the popularities of the Burgundian Position and Traditionalist Wing withing the SBB."
 BRT.38.a:0 "Just as planned."
 BRT.39.t:0 "No Mercy for Traitors"
 BRT.39.desc:0 "At dawn, the Bezen Perrot moved out in force. Members of the government opposing Lainé were hunted down en masse, imprisoned if practical, executed if possible. The three main players of the government were the main objectives of the operation.\n\nFrançois Debeauvais, the Head of Government, was located within his home in Brest. The unit made assaulted the building, catching Debeauvais still in bed. Unfortunately, an error in judgement resulted in the death of his family along with him.\n\nYann Fouéré, the Delaporte plant within the government, was ambushed while on his way to work. The car he was in was filled with lead while stuck in traffic, resulting in the deaths of him and his driver.\n\nYann Bricler, Mordrel's cousin and no stranger to attempts on his life, was found in a small Brest café. Not going out without a fight, he managed to wound two members of the Bezen Perrot, before being taken out. The firefight sadly resulted in a number of civilian casualties.\n\nAs chaos and panic began spreading through Brest, only the head of the snake remained standing."
 BRT.39.a:0 "Ready or not..."
 BRT.40.t:0 "Risky Business"
 BRT.40.desc:0 "While Delaporte and Lainé scheme behind the scenes, thinking that Mordrel is not fully aware of their little plans for revolution, Mordrel has been preparing a scheme of his own. For too long the extremists have been allowed to run freely. It's high time to put an end to it.\n\nThe democrats claim a majority of their legitimacy from the fact that Yann Fouéré, one of theirs, occupies a seat in the government. While Fouéré is their greatest strength, he is also their weakest link. Dealing with him should neutralize the SAV.\n\nAs for the Lainé clique within the SBB, the Bezen Perrot is their base of power. By either containing or purging to paramilitary organization we can cut Lainé's influence down to its appropriate size.\n\nHowever we choose to deal with the dissidents, in the end, the house always wins."
 BRT.40.a:0 "Let's see their hands."
 BRT.41.t:0 "Fouéré's Vow"
 BRT.41.desc:0 "Evidently the news did not come as a surprise; Fouéré had already packed his bags, ready to leave as the police arrived at his residence to enforce the exile. When questioned later, the officers mentioned how Fouéré had seemed to be in a hurry, even. Understandable, considering the stunt he pulled.\n\nWe presume the mass of letters, with his signature in each one, had been sent the night before he left the country. Practically all representatives of the Committee who had ever so much as said a good word about democracy had received this short manifesto. The contents of this essay are not important, but surely enough, this successful, if petty, revenge has made us look bad.\n\nAs for Fouéré, he has already reached Ireland, and is out of our reach. It seems he is now organizing a society for other exiled Bretons, though only time will tell if it remains a simple literature club, or if it evolves into something more dangerous."

 BRT.43.desc:0 "\"Battle\" is a bit much, though that's what the later generations would come to call it. As the morning sun rose over Brest, the people began emerging from their homes, banners in tow. Soon enough, the streets were filled with demonstrators, making their way towards the halls of the government.\n\nAlready having been notified to make himself scarce, Mordrel himself was nowhere to be found. The Bezen Perrot guards who had showed up for work chose not to open fire on the thousands of Bretons marching their way. The building was captured, and Raymond Delaporte, who had been marching right beside the people, emerged from the masses to deliver his first speech as the first president of Brittany."

 BRT.51.desc:0 "While our choice of choosing to support Speer in the conflict has gone over well with many within the National Committee, a voice of protest has risen from Célestin Lainé and the ranks of his supporters. Supporting Speer, he says, is a fools errand, as he and his unwashed hordes of students stand no chance against the likes of Heydrich and the German SS.\n\nWhile the good minister's insults have mostly been ignored, having further discord within the National Committee is never a profitable thing."

 BRT.52.t:0 "Delaporte Protests"
 BRT.52.desc:0 "Our choice of supporting Heydrich has not gone without notice within the National Committee. Heated discussions have erupted between Lainé, who wholeheartedly supports the move, and Delaporte, who is doing everything in his power to reverse what he sees to be a critical error of judgement. The arguments between the two are mirrored in the more physical confrontations of their supporters.\n\nAs discord within the National Committee rises, and political violence on the streets of Brest increases, we can only hope our gamble pays off in the end."

 BRT.53.t:0 "Lainé and Delaporte Protest"
 BRT.53.desc:0 "As far as common ground goes, Lainé and Delaporte have not had much between them for many years. However, since we announced the choice of not supporting any one side in the German civil war, the two of them, along with their supporters, have repeatedly criticized the decision. Luckily for us, as soon as the two realized they're working together, discussion simmered down to an appropriate minimum.\n\nRegardless, it will take some time and effort to return things to working order within the National Committee."
 BRT.53.a:0 "Business as usual."
 BRT.54.t:0 "Democratic Demonstrations"
 BRT.54.desc:0 "As winds of change are blowing, the common people can't help but get swept away in the excitement. What began as a run-of-the-mill soapboxing event in central Brest quickly escalated into numerous demonstrations all around the city, and within days, all major cities in Brittany. The protesters are marching for democracy, and are being encouraged by Delaporte and his lackeys.\n\nWhile minor confrontations between the protesters and police have been reported, the marches have so far remained peaceful."

 BRT.55.t:0 "Bezen Perrot Parade"
 BRT.55.desc:0 "In response to the recent democratic demonstrations around the country, the Bezen Perrot has mobilized in force. Thousands of local members in marching formations forced their way through democratic protests in Brest, and as one might imagine, a violent clash began. Both sides were more than eager to rise to the challenge, and for hours, central Brest turned into a scene of medieval pandemonium. Miraculously enough, neither side fired the first shot, and the clashes did not claim any lives.\n\nAlready Lainé and his cohorts have announced further parades to be held, not only in Brest, but all around Brittany."

Knowing full well that their degenerate ways of life are at danger, the protesters have primarily targeted Bezen Perrot installations. This was their first and final mistake.\n\nThe protesters, unarmed and cocksure, were met with hails of gunfire from the local garrisons. While the count is still ongoing, dozens have been confirmed dead, and more than two hundred protesters have been wounded. The Bezen Perrot has managed to avoid casualties, apart from a few wounded.\n\nThe effective crackdown of the protests has ensured that none have emerged since."

 BRT.57.desc:0 "The recent protests proved that there was a need for a symbol of Burgundian power within Brittany. The \"Château de Brest\", as it was formerly known, has been chosen as this symbol. A number of advisors secretly sent from Burgundy have supported our efforts in turning the old castle into a base of operations for the Bezen Perrot.\n\nAs preparations were completed, the first customers were not far behind. A number of protest leaders and other undesirables were collected from their holding cells around Brittany, and are now being interrogated to root out their co-conspirators.\n\nAs expected, it does not take many extremities to get the traitors to talk, and the Bezen Perrot has been quite busy rounding up those who survived the protests."

In their search for a representative to defend the interests of the military, Goulven Pennaod stepped forward.\n\nA popular character among the public, Pennaod is known for being a promising general, fiercely loyal to Brittany, and a fascist only in name. While the fact that this \"Military Clique\" exists within our young democracy is somewhat worrysome, Delaporte does not believe that Pennaod has any nefarious plans.\n\nAnd, if nothing else, it's good to have a boogeyman to scare those not willing to fall in line with."

After his upcoming retirement, where would the vast wealth he had gathered along the years lead him? Somewhere tropical? Or perhaps temperate? The sight inside the opening safe have the answer: Wherever he damn well pleased.\n\nBut one thing was certain. After years of blood, sweat and tears, his future home would need to fulfill but one requirement;"

 BRT.101.desc:0 "The sounds of celebration faded as Delaporte closed the door behind him. He needed some breathing space, and what better place than his personal office. As he cracked the window, the sounds of a different celebration filled the office; The streets of Brest were quite full of his jubilant supporters. This sight was the breath he had been looking for.\n\nAs his mind wandered, so did his eyes, as he caught sight of an old photograph on his desk. The three of them looked so young back then. More than twenty years younger, to be specific. And much happier. Poor, misguided Célestin, so full of life back then. And Olier, well, Olier looked as tired as he always had. But back then, as much of an ideologue as Raymond.\n\nHe had sacrificed as much as any other democrat in Brittany, he thought to himself. But there was no price too high for liberty, as the slogans said. The sight from his window seemed to reinforce this thought. As he took in the air of freedom one more time, he closed the window, and headed back to the celebrations."

 BRT.102.t:0 "The Watchman"
 BRT.102.desc:0 "The thumping of hands on his back woke Pennaod from his stupor. As his junior officers congratulated him, he could scarcely believe it; He had been chosen as the first democratically elected president of Brittany. Though he had never had any interest in the position, his colleagues had convinced him that the dangers of too much freedom could place all Bretons in danger. And to a degree, he agreed; There was no way Burgundy would look from the sidelines should, God forbid, a left-wing government rise to power in Brittany.\n\nAmong the general staff, Pennaod was chosen as the representative of the so-called Military Clique. Again an honor he had not asked for, but after his election, he began to wonder if fate did not care for what he wished for. If things kept going like this, he'd eventually find himself Führer of the Reich. The silly thought made him smile, and as he looked up, he saw the rest of his friends smiling as well. Perhaps things would turn for the better after all.\n\nAs for the fate of Brittany, Pennaod had a clear plan; The democratic processes would be reformed under the guidance of the Military Clique, and only when everything was perfectly ready, new elections could be held. This was Delaportes mistake after all; Too much, too fast. Should everything go as planned, Pennaods Military Clique would become the guardians of democracy. And Pennaod was ready to do whatever it takes to make his plans a reality."

With Delaporte, having taken the brunt of any backlash from the revolution, out of the way, he could focus on his grander project; Reinforcing democracy throughout Europe. In his vision, Brittany would become the very definition of a democratic nation, a shining beacon for all of Europe to follow. And in time, like Brittany, Europe would be free as well.\n\nHowever, his more grandiose plans would still have to wait; Delaporte still posed a threat, and the upstart Pennaod could prove equally dangerous.

 BRT.104.desc:0 "One of the many secretaries he had hurried out of the room after delivering the report. As Lainé picked up the folder, a chill of disgust ran down his spine; This non-profit organization was very much familiar to him. For years, they had been monitoring Breton Black Market activities on a global scale, disrupting business whenever they could. Ever since Lainé had diversified the Market, the organization had grown nearly fanatical in their anti-Breton propaganda.\n\nHe tossed the folder in the trash. They could whine as much as they wanted, but there was nothing they could do to stop him. The Black Market had gathered many powerful allies during its existance, from criminal organizations to government agencies, all willing to lend a hand in exchange for a favor or two. And most importantly, Lainé could trust that Brittany stood behind him.\n\nAn age of unprecedented wealth had convinced Bretons that their way of life was right. And Lainé agreed, wholeheartedly."

It didn't matter if some of the smiles were forced; At the very least, they knew their places. There's nothing quite as beautiful as an orderly society, he figured. But with that thought, something darker came to mind.\n\nDespite his best efforts, there were still elements in the Breton society opposed to his new order. As he walked the streets, the signs were everywhere; A graffiti there, a foreign language overheard here, minds too relaxed everywhere. There was still much work to do if he wanted Brittany to be the great society he imagined, knew, it could be.\n\nAs he walked past an arrest in progress, the strikes of batons on degenerates reminded him; Almost there. Keep going. No sacrifice is too great for true liberty."

Named after Jean-Marie Perrot, a Breton nationalist assassinated by communist partisans, the unit saw much action in their anti-partisan duties during the war. With Germany victorious, the Bezen Perrot had played a crucial role in achieving what countless Bretons in the past had only dreamed of: Liberating Brittany.\n\nToday, the Bezen Perrot has grown from its Waffenverband days into a considerable force, having considerable influence over the armed forces and the defense of Brittany. However, the Bezen Perrot is still considered to be the armed wing of the Strollad Broadel Breizh (Having ousted the Bagadoù Stourm from its position as the SBB's paramilitary force), and therefore has much say in the politics of Brittany.\n\nThis fact has not eluded the leader of the Bezen Perrot, Célestin Lainé, and with the recent friction between Lainé and Mordrel, the Bezen Perrot may be aiming to gain a majority within the SBB."

 BRT_we_dont_choose_favorites:0 "We Don't Choose Favorites"
 BRT_we_dont_choose_favorites_desc:0 "Choosing to back a single side of the civil war positively reeks of bad business practice. It would be much more beneficial for the Germans to tear into eachother for as long as possible, with as many Breton guns as humanly possible."
 BRT_breton_guns:0 "Breton Guns"
 BRT_breton_guns_desc:0 "While most of the weapons we sell on the black market are produced in foreign countries, Brittany does have a weapons industry all its own. Domestic weapons are also much cheaper to produce when compared to foreign imports."
 BRT_fine_arms_for_dirty_hands:0 "Fine Arms For Dirty Hands"
 BRT_fine_arms_for_dirty_hands_desc:0 "Brittany tends to be a mere checkpoint for weapons, as they head overseas as soon as they arrive. However, with recent developments on the world stage, keeping a few guns for a rainy day wouldn't be a bad idea."

 BRT_born_to_compete_never_retreat_desc:0 "\"They study to vanquish\".\n\nThe Special Military School of Saint-Cyr, abandoned by the French during their general rout in 1940, has remained in a state of relative disrepair since the final class left.

 BRT_move_against_the_bezen_perott:0 "Move Against the Bezen Perrot"
 BRT_move_against_the_bezen_perott_desc:0 "The Bezen Perrot has served the nation well, but their influence has grown too large.

 BRT_the_battle_for_rennes:0 "Battle for Brest"
 BRT_the_battle_for_rennes_desc:0 "It was never going to be easy, overthrowing a government. There's no tree of liberty to refresh, and as such, the weeds spoiling Breton soil must be uprooted. Only then can we plant the seeds of liberty."
 BRT_a_better_brittany:0 "A Better Brittany"

 BRT_for_gain:0 "For Gain"
 BRT_for_gain_desc:0 "Sic semper erat, et sic semper erit.\n\nFixing a system that's working just fine is a fools errand. Mordrel understands this, and knows exactly what to do in order to quiet the opposition."

 BRT_woo_yann_fouere:0 "Woo Yann Fouéré"
 BRT_woo_yann_fouere_desc:0 "Fouéré may lean towards the democratic side of things, but he is a capable minister regardless. We can make him understand that slowing down on the harmful rhetoric is his only chance of retaining his position."
 BRT_purge_the_bezen_perrot:0 "Purge the Bezen Perrot"
 BRT_purge_the_bezen_perrot_desc:0 "Lainé and the Bezen Perrot have grown out of proportion. By making an example out of him, the rest of the general staff can be brought in line."
 BRT_contain_the_bezen_perrot:0 "Contain the Bezen Perrot"
 BRT_contain_the_bezen_perrot_desc:0 "Completely disbanding the Bezen Perrot may not be the smartest move. Simply cutting them down to size ought to be enough."
 BRT_an_unscrupulous_brittany:0 "An Unscrupulous Brittany"
 BRT_an_unscrupulous_brittany_desc:0 "With treasonous voices shut down, the future is looking very much profitable for Brittany. Perhaps it's time for that market expansion that's been in the works for quite some time now?"
 BRT_for_power:0 "For Strength"

 BRT_gather_the_bezen_perrot_desc:0 "A candle lit on a window sill of a specific window of the barracks. An innocent sentence uttered during a routine radio check. The Bezen Perrot has been preparing for the possibility of a military coup for years, and the time has finally come. As signals spread through Brittany, the officers brief their most trustworthy men, and make sure the rest won't get in the way."
 BRT_kill_them_all:0 "Kill Them All"
 BRT_kill_them_all_desc:0 "The men are in positions around Brest. Mordrel's sycophants won't see their end coming. There will be no mercy for the traitors."

 BRT_the_hole_in_the_curtain_desc:0 "Brittany, while it has its vibrant culture, people and language, is now known for the one sole object it's economy is built upon; The Black Market. From all walks of the world, items of all kind, most illegal, flood into Brittany and its ports. From weaponry ranging from handguns to tanks and jet fighters, to illegal contraband such as art, books and movies, Brittany's black market is astronomically larger than any other's in the world."
 BRT_goods_from_the_free_world:0 "Goods from the Free World"

 BRT_western_machiness:0 "Western Machines"
 BRT_western_machiness_desc:0 "While the nations of the Pakt have somewhat lost their edge on the industrial expertise front, due to common reliance on slave labour, other western nations are pushing ahead with technological leaps.

 BRT_pacific_merchant_fleets_desc:0 "A ship in every port, as they say. Breton seamen are a common sight in ports around the world, having sailed in with one of our many commercial vessels. The Breton flag may not wave on vast stretches of land, but the seven seas are very much black and white."
 BRT_arsenals_of_democracy:0 "Arsenals of Democracy"
 BRT_arsenals_of_democracy_desc:0 "As the main supplier of all OFN countries, the United States is one of the top producers of weaponry in the world. As such, American weapons are fairly easy to come by in the less stable parts of the OFN."

 BRT_guns_of_the_triumvirate_desc:0 "The Triumvirate that rules what remains of the Mediterranean make a significant portion of the world's weapon production. It's not uncommon for large amounts of weaponry to simply vanish in the colonies of Africa and the Middle East."
 BRT_tools_of_supremacy:0 "Tools of Supremacy"
 BRT_tools_of_supremacy_desc:0 "As the industrial powerhouse of the Sphere, Japan is the top producer of weapons in East Asia.

 BRT_technological_secrets:0 "Technological Secrets"

 BRT_colonial_experiences_desc:0 "Many of the contacts we have in the colonial regions of the various nations of the world have many an interesting tale to tell. Retired soldiers, undercover freedom fighters, anyone worth making contact with on behalf of the black market is bound to be beneficial in many other ways as well."
 BRT_intelligence_down_under:0 "Tales from the East"
 BRT_intelligence_down_under_desc:0 "While the majority of the \"civilized\" world remains oblivious to the situation within the former Soviet Union, our Market Research Division has a fairly good understanding of what happens in Russia. And as one might expect, warfare is the word of the day, every day. As one of the few regions of the world locked in more or less constant conflict, our contacts can easily acquire vital experience regarding military developments."
 BRT_lawless_wastelands:0 "Lawless Wastelands"
 BRT_lawless_wastelands_desc:0 "The warlord states of the former Soviet Union have been in a constant state of strife since the final breath of the Soviets in the 50's.

 BRT_ventures_into_western_russia:0 "Ventures into Western Russia"
 BRT_ventures_into_western_russia_desc:0 "The warlords west of the Urals include a colorful cast of characters from any and all ideologies one could conjure up.

 BRT_the_great_steppe:0 "The Great Steppes"
 BRT_the_great_steppe_desc:0 "From the Kazakh Steppe to Mongolia, warlords are fighting over control of the southern edges of the fallen Soviet nation. For as long as the various hordes and other rabble keep fighting each other, we ought to make the best of the situation."
 BRT_free_europe:0 "Free Europe"

Clearly the most liberal of the presidential candidates, Fouéré may be able to unite the somewhat chaotic BNC behind a common cause.\n\nLast, but certainly not the least, stands the leader of the Military Clique, Goulven Pennaod. His candidacy, born out of a black swan event caused by the general staff's worries about the increasing left-wing influence in the government, is considered a mere protest move by some, but Pennaod's popularity within Brittany as the leader of loyalist army forces and the protector of the republic could very well translate into electoral success.\n\nThe ballots are open, and so is Brittany's future."
