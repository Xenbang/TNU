SHX_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Shaanxi was among the first Chinese provinces to fall to Japanese and Mongol forces in the early 1940's. Stiff resistance from communist partisans and KMT holdouts was found throughout the province but when faced by the might of Japan and their Chinese puppet the resistance was crushed and ultimately forced underground. In the post war settlement Shaanxi found itself only under the nominal authority of the weekend Nanjing government. Today the province exists as yet another Japanese dependency, lead in principal by the beaten general Fu Zuoyi. Unstably bridging the gap between China proper and the barbarian western states Shaanxi will have a step hill to climb if it ever seeks to change its lot in the world."

POLITICS_FU_ZUOYI_DESC:0 "Fu Zuoyi is the best kind of traitor. The one that deserts to the right side. Never quite the most ideological of men, Fu was through and through a pupil of Yan Xishan's transcendantal philosophy of political thought, and accompanied the warlord on every one of his expeditions, eventually embedding himself into the old Kuomintang. While commanding half a million men and being responsible for a number of early victories against the Japanese, Fu suddenly surrendered his entire army, citing his disillusionment with Chiang Kai-Shek. In that way the prolonged Battle of Xian came to an end with an astounding Japanese victory.\n\nFu's actions guaranteed him a high position in the post-war Japanese order, a position which he was promptly given. While de jure simply governor of Shaanxi province, Fu is now the chief warlord of the region. Perhaps he was given the province to deter him from turning his backs on Japan again. Perhaps they exiled him to central China so he wouldn't fight for his country again. Once traitors betray their nation, there's nothing stopping them from doing it again."
