 POLITICS_BA_MAW_DESC:0 "Doctor Ba Maw, bestowed with the title of Nai Ba Maw by his supporters, and the nickname of "Burma's Tojo" as his detractors, is the first, and, to date, only Naingandaw Adipadi of the State of Burma. Installed upon his throne of iron by the Japanese in their rampage through Asia, he was at first supported by the Thakin Comrades, but, as the 1950s began with ethnic clashes, terrorism, and an increasingly powerful Japanese economic and military presence in Burma, they grew impatient with the General.\n\nAs the years pass by, Ba Maw has become an unpopular figurehead. Serving as the civilian administrator to a joint Japanese-Thakin military government with frequent infighting, he longs to return to his post as Burma's true ruler. Supported by the rest of his Freedom Bloc, he shall crush those terrorists and the Moderate Thakins, and create a truly free Burmese nation!"
