 WORLD.2.t:0 "Adolf Hitler Has Died"
 WORLD.2.d:0 "Tragedy has consumed Germany as the news spread first throughout the Reich and then the world. Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany and victor of the Second World War, has died. Whilst the Führer's declining health had been speculated about for some time, the news has nevertheless left Germany in a state of complete shock. The Reichstag has announced that three months of mourning shall be held, and that the Führer shall be buried beside his late wife, Eva Hitler, with dignitaries from around the world invited to the funeral.\n\nWhile Germany mourns, internationally many are celebrating the death of the man held responsible for three decades of suffering throughout the world. Yet many international commentators fear what may now become of Germany, the Third Reich having already been embattled in a bitter power struggle over the rightful successor to the Führership."
 WORLD.2.a:0 "A day to remember..."

 # WORLD.4.t:0 "Adolf Hitler Has Died"
 # WORLD.4.d:0 "Adolf Hitler, Führer of the Greater Germanic Reich, victor of the Second World War, is dead.\n\nWhile it came as a surprise to some, to most, it was not. Within Germany, the entire nation mourns the man who kept the Reich together through twenty years of strife. Outside the Reich, perhaps the largest celebration in history is occurring. From Washington to Tokyo, from Cape Town to Arkangelsk, people have taken to the streets, celebrating the death of the man who has thrown the world into so much misery.\n\nNow the question remains - what will become of the Third Reich without its leader?"
 # WORLD.4.a:0 "A day to remember..."

 WORLD.5.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 WORLD.5.d:0 "In the wake of Adolf Hitler's death, the Reich has erupted into chaos. Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."
 WORLD.5.a:0 "The end of the Reich, surely."

 WORLD.11.t:0 "The Reich's Last Conquest"
 WORLD.11.desc:0 "On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner became the first man to ever land on the Moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the Moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."

 WORLD.20.t:0 "The Collapse of the Triumvirate"
 WORLD.20.d:0 "In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the caudillos and the Turkish president have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to Cyprus and the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems."
 WORLD.20.a:0 "It was only a matter of time."

 WORLD.23.t:0 "Expansion Into Africa"
 WORLD.23.d:0 "West Africa has had it rough since the end of the Second World War. Luftwaffe units based out of the Reich's holdings in Central Africa have, for the past two decades, bombed anything inland into dust.\n\nWith the death of Hitler and the collapse of the Reich, those Luftwaffe units haven't moved in a long time. Already, several small nations on the coast have begun expanding their borders inland, free from the fear of constant German bombing. Whether the bombing resumes or not, only time will tell."
 WORLD.23.a:0 "Interesting."

 WORLD.24.a:0 "Okay"

 WORLD.28.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact Forms"
 WORLD.28.desc:0 "The German Civil War has taken many twists and turns, but this may be the strangest of them all. Earlier today, multiple contenders to the Führership have announced a temporary ceasefire between them in order to focus on what they have deemed "the largest threat to the Reich today" - Reinhard Heydrich and his SS.\n\nHeydrich and the SS, backed only by Heinrich Himmler, have made surprising gains in recent months despite their poor starting position and lack of political power or popular appeal. It appears that this has spooked the other contenders, whose forces now gather to put an end to Heydrich's armies. With Heydrich being a proud follower of both Himmler and his 'Burgundian system', it must be a relief to Germans everywhere that their leaders can at least agree on one thing - mutual hatred of the SS and what it stands for."
 WORLD.28.a:0 "Himmler's madness will not spread to our soil!"
 WORLD.28.b:0 "Let them come."
 WORLD.28.c:0 "Heydrich will handle this with ease."
 WORLD.28.d:0 "It could always be worse."

 WORLD.34.t:0 "Assassin Strikes at Hitler!"
 WORLD.34.d:0 "News from Germany is sporadic at best. Information smuggled out of Germania reports that shortly after celebrations over the Moon landing settled, military units and several platoons worth of bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. Apparently, an assassin, which the Germans claim belonged to the Japanese Kenpeitai, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards.\n\nAlready, reports of various other assassinations have surfaced. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as several units ordered each other to stand down and the chain of command fell apart. Suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. Can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"
 WORLD.34.a:0 "A house divided..."
 WORLD.34.b:0 "Oh no."

 WORLD.35.t:0 "The South African War"
 WORLD.35.desc:0 "Violence erupted across South Africa today as the Boer Republic, angered at what they have perceived as endless attacks on themselves by the South African government, formally declared its independence from the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAccompanying the declaration Boer militias, carrying mostly German armaments, have spread out across the Orange Free State and numerous other parts of Northwestern South Africa, coming into armed conflict with South African soldiers stationed in the area.\n\nAs the conflict continues to escalate, it is currently unknown what exactly the German response will be. Yet as observers report increasing militarization of the South African border by the newly formed Afrika-Schild, many consider the German response to be self-evident."
 WORLD.35.a:0 "For freedom!"
 WORLD.35.b:0 "A perfect opportunity..."
 WORLD.35.c:0 "They'll doom us all!"
 WORLD.35.d:0 "Africa in chaos. Typical."

 WORLD.36.t:0 "Afrika-Schild Intervenes In South Africa"
 WORLD.36.desc:0 "As the Boer rebellion rages on, international journalists on the ground are reporting that German colonial panzer divisions have now begun to pour across the South African border in a rapid escalation of the conflict. Forces of the newly formed 'Afrika-Schild' have already won several key victories, forcing already stretched thin South African soldiers into retreating south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for almost a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by quickly spreading footage of a battle-bloody South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, who asked the cameras the question that many have been asking:\n\n"Where the fuck are the Yankees?""
 WORLD.36.a:0 "Truest allies!"
 WORLD.36.b:0 "True glory shall be had!"
 WORLD.36.c:0 "True snakes!"
 WORLD.36.d:0 "True chaos! When will it end?"

 WORLD.37.t:0 "The Franco-Burgundian War"
 WORLD.37.desc:0 "As the situation within Europe rapidly develops as the German sphere free falls into total collapse, many have wondered what if any move the secretive 'black state' would make. With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.\n\nYet the true reasoning has now revealed itself. While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands."
 WORLD.37.a:0 "God save us!"
 WORLD.37.b:0 "They shall know power."
 WORLD.37.c:0 "A shadow looms over France..."

 WORLD.38.t:0 "A Well-Advised War"
 WORLD.38.desc:0 "The first American 'advisors' landed in South Africa today as part of a joint task-force between the United States Marines and Army under the Military Assistance Advisory Group, or MAAG. Led by the newly promoted General Paul D. Harkins, the MAAG is ostensibly only advisors to train and prepare South African soldiers to assist them in their battle against the encroaching RKs, with the U.S. government claiming they are not fighting the war, merely "aiding a fellow free nation in their darkest hour".\n\nThis has raised many eyebrows, especially as U.S. bombers off of the USS Saratoga and Essex have already began pummeling German positions and U.S. military members have been photographed alongside their South African counterparts in heavy fighting. Whether as part of an 'Advisory Group' or as part of an army, the United States has now joined the South African War. Time will tell if the rest of the OFN shall follow..."
 WORLD.38.a:0 "Those dogs!"
 WORLD.38.b:0 "Send a formal complaint immediately!"
 WORLD.38.c:0 "Our friends at last!"
 WORLD.38.d:0 "Let's rock and roll!"
 WORLD.38.e:0 "American adventurism in Africa? Who would have thought."

 WORLD.39.t:0 "The OFN Agrees!"
 WORLD.39.desc:0 "In perhaps unsurprising news, the OFN has agreed to join America in the ongoing struggle in South Africa. With enough votes to push the organization into the war, the allied nations of the United States have already began landing in South African ports, flying over Boer skies and fighting across the rugged battlefields of Africa. This news has been celebrated by the United States who has proclaimed that the OFN has proven that it is dedicated to the safety and protection of all free people of the world, with politicians and generals both decrying those who have accused the OFN of being a do-nothing organization. It remains to be seen how useful this will be to South Africa, though the South African military is reportedly pleased."
 WORLD.39.a:0 "Fools! All of them!"
 WORLD.39.b:0 "How dare they gang up on us!? We're innocent!"
 WORLD.39.c:0 "By our powers combined!"
 WORLD.39.d:0 "We never had any doubt."
 WORLD.39.e:0 "All for one, and one for all!"
 WORLD.39.f:0 "Will this chaos ever end!?"

 WORLD.40.t:0 "The OFN Protests!"
 WORLD.40.desc:0 "In shocking news, the U.S. war conference with the rest of the OFN has fallen apart into infighting. After numerous votes against, the diplomats from the United States called off the vote and reportedly stormed from the meeting chambers. While U.S. allies in the OFN are berating their fellow members of the organization for "sabotaging the integrity of the great institution", they can do little to truly force these nations to participate and what's being increasingly called an 'American war'. The United States has stated it will not let petty politics stop its now surely damaged mission to South Africa, and that it and its true allies would be joining the war regardless of what anyone may think. One thing is for certain however, the reputation of the OFN is surely tarnished."
 WORLD.40.a:0 "The international community speaks for freedom!"
 WORLD.40.b:0 "They fear our might!"
 WORLD.40.c:0 "What!? Are you kidding me!?"
 WORLD.40.d:0 "What a bunch of idiots."
 WORLD.40.e:0 "A house divided..."
 WORLD.40.f:0 "An eagle without talons, it seems."

 WORLD.41.t:0 "The Third Battle of London"
 WORLD.41.desc:0 "Chaos in the streets of London! American reporters were, as always, the first to break the news while the international community has struggled to play catchup with the shocking news of violence spreading across England. It seems that while chaos reigns on the mainland, the British resistance has decided to make their move.\n\nPerhaps most shocking is their leader. Claude Auchinleck, former British general in charge of defending the isles during the German invasion, now leads a coalition of resistance groups across the nation in rebellion against the Germans. Auchinleck had been a quiet, diminutive card carrying member of the nation's Royal Party, but now leads his men in full military uniform in battle against the German garrison and the local collaborators. He proclaims, alongside his allies from a dozen different ideologies of twice that many resistance groups, that England shall be free again... or that they shall all die as free men."
 WORLD.41.a:0 "Britannia shall rise anew!"
 WORLD.41.b:0 "Chaos! Chaos everywhere!"
 WORLD.41.c:0 "What the hell!?"
 WORLD.41.d:0 "Rise, brothers! Rise!"
 WORLD.41.e:0 "The isles burn anew!"

 WORLD.42.t:0 "A Lullaby to Britannia"
 WORLD.42.desc:0 "The Germans breath a sigh of relief, the Americans and the OFN curse in dismay, and the English once more find themselves shackled under the collaborators. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and the many resistance cells it contained have been destroyed by the English government, those few survivors finding themselves captured or routed to Wales and Scotland where they will no doubt harass the English for years to come. The coalition of resistance forces is dead, and Auchinleck himself has disappeared. What exactly has become of the leader is unknown.\n\nThe rebellion, the final one for the English many believe, is over, a last cry of freedom harshly beaten down, a final flickering flame hushed out in the dead of night.\n\nWith the resistance destroyed, the English government now moves to rebuild the nation and look to the future. Many, however, question if England might be irrevocably changed. Will the Germans still trust the English to handle their own affairs? And will the English still bow to German whims after this show of defiance?"
 WORLD.42.a:0 "We look to a better future."
 WORLD.42.b:0 "A great sign to partisans across Europe!"
 WORLD.42.c:0 "We will return lads. One day."
 WORLD.42.d:0 "A reminder of the strength of tyranny."

 WORLD.43.t:0 "An Ode to Britannia!"
 WORLD.43.desc:0 "English soldiers tear off their patches and flags and help cheering civilians raise flags of the now free England and the long-dead United Kingdom aloft across London and across the nation. Civilians roam the streets in Cornwall free from fear for the first time in decades, children laughing and pelting refuse on the long columns of German POWs being escorted to holding camps across the nation. Pubs across England proudly declare that all drinks are free to the brave members of HMMLR and the united British resistance of Wales, Cornwall and England. This of course means that drinks are free to all, the already blurry line of who constitutes a member of these shadowy cells becoming blurrier under the powers of strong drink, proud song and boisterous celebration.\n\nFrom the steps of the now liberated Westminster with his rapidly assembled cabinet, Auchinleck has declared himself defense secretary and declared a brief period of martial law until the new government can be formed and England restored to order. Until then however, the streets are owned by the people, and their raucous celebrations."
 WORLD.43.a:0 "We look to a better future."
 WORLD.43.b:0 "Damnation! Insanity! Pure insanity!"
 WORLD.43.c:0 "Three cheers for our comrades in the homeland!"
 WORLD.43.d:0 "On English neck, no boot sits."

 WORLD.44.t:0 "The Indian Civil War"
 WORLD.44.desc:0 "As the world teeters on the brink, another nation has fallen. India, hoped by many in the free world to stay a beacon of democracy sandwiched between two fascist spheres, has collapsed into civil war. Fascists under M.S. Golwalkar, authoritarian socialists seeking an India without bourgeoisie democracy, separatists fighting for independence, and the remains of the government now vie for their goals not in the Lok Sabha but in the fields of India.\n\nThe world holds its breath, for the outcome of this war could change the balance of power across Asia and perhaps even the world. The fascist powers watch eagerly, hoping to see another nation carry the torch of fascism and align with their causes. Democracies can only hope that the INC holds and regains control. Revolutionary cells across the globe can only pray for their comrades, for perhaps this is the time that the world could finally see another socialist nation. Most eager of all, Azad Hind scrambles to react, seeing the first opportunity in decades to reunite India under their vision.\n\nAs always, the powers of the world are eager to see opportunity."
 WORLD.44.a:0 "The Crown Jewel lies shattered."
 WORLD.44.b:0 "Jai Hind!"
 WORLD.44.c:0 "Perhaps we may find opportunity..."

 WORLD.46.c:0 "We stand united against extremism!"
 WORLD.46.d:0 "How dare they?!"

 WORLD.47.t:0 "Hans Speidel Assumes Control of Germania"
 WORLD.47.desc:0 "With Germany having collapsed into civil war across the country, even at this early state of the conflict the toll both in terms of lives and destruction is rapidly becoming apparent. Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the emergency council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."
 WORLD.47.a:0 "The hero we needed."
 WORLD.47.b:0 "More trouble in Germany."

 WORLD.48.t:0 "Formation of the Afrika-Schild"
 WORLD.48.desc:0 "With Germany still consumed by the chaos of civil war and many of its territories becoming plagued with conflicts of their own, German Africa has today announced its intention to weather this terrible storm. Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the "immoral, colonial alliance", many within the German sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent."
 WORLD.48.a:0 "We stand together."
 WORLD.48.b:0 "A worrying development."

 WORLD.51.t:0 "Yemen in Chaos!"
 WORLD.51.d:0 "The Yemeni city of Sana'a was thrown into absolute chaos today as forces loyal to the newly declared Yemeni Arab Republic bombarded the homes of the nation's imam and king. The movement seems inspired by the rising sentiment of pan-Arabism in the Middle East, and already a revolutionary republic has been declared in Yemen that the new government claims will one day join with a union of all of its "brother Arab nation states".\n\nDespite this regime's claims to the contrary, King Muhammad Al-Badr has survived, and has unified multiple tribes in the nation, mostly irregular religious fanatics, to his cause. Italy has also announced that it would do anything in its power to assist the king, who despite pan-Arab sentiments of his own, has as of yet remained loyal to Italy and her interests."
 WORLD.51.a:0 "Who cares what happens in Yemen?"

 WORLD.66.t:0 "The English Civil War"
 WORLD.66.d:0 "As the German Civil War and its proxy conflicts tear apart Europe, the fires have seemingly spread to England.\n\nClaude Auchinleck, famous for being general to surrender during the German invasion and having spent the last ten years as a seemingly proud member of the collaborator regime, has declared a free England and revealed himself as the previously mysterious leader of the united English resistance group, Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. Already, partisan brigades from resistance cells, including Bill Alexander's Communist Front which had allied with HMMLR previously in the year, have taken much from the collaborators. The garrison in Cornwall have already begun rolling into England proper, but the scale of this uprising is unprecedented, even with two large scale uprisings in the past."
 WORLD.66.a:0 "Will England finally be free?"

 WORLD.67.t:0 "Collapse of German Madagaskar"
 WORLD.67.d:0 "Admiral Thomas Moorer of the OFN's Indian Ocean Command affirms that the situation in German Madagascar had reached a stage of open rebellion against the government of Reichkommissar Emil Maurice. Although Madagaskar, much like other German territories, is plagued by the issue of native resistance to colonial rule, Moorer confidently announced that it was the German garrison which mutinied. Earlier reports also confirmed that both the native Malagasy and the Jewish population of the island had subsequently taken up arms.\n\nNo comment on the uprising was forthcoming from Germania, with unofficial reports indicating a general indifference about the island's fate. Experts agree that, with political instability regarding the succession of Adolf Hitler, the island, often used by the Reich to exile those who have fallen out of favor, is unlikely to receive much attention there.\n"
 WORLD.67.a:0 "The everlasting legacy of the Reich."

 WORLD.68.t:0 "Freedom for Angola?"
 WORLD.68.d:0 "As the South African War continues to envelop the entire Southern African continent, a baffling report has come back from the capital of Südwestafrika: early in the day, half a dozen of Luftwaffe transports planes took off heading to a destination unknown, amongst its passengers Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck, his closest aides, and their families. In an even more shocking turn of events, the Reichskommissar's private doctor, Jonas Savimbi, proceeded to make a speech on Radio Luanda hours after the plane left, declaring himself president of an independent Angola, and calling his citizens to take up arms and defend the newborn nation. Thousands of Ovimbundu militiamen, alongside native SS units stationed at the rear have already pledged allegiance to the new president, with fighting between them and their former Schild allies already erupting across Angola."
 WORLD.68.a:0 "Wait, what?"

 WORLD.101.t:0 "Twilight of Civilization"
 WORLD.101.desc:0 "Washington D.C., Germania and Tokyo sit in rubble, nuclear fire having scorched them from this Earth in a matter of moments. Across the world, power stations fail, clouds of ash blot out the sun, and astronauts from various nations watch as the lights blink out one by one like dying stars.\n\nThe world is silent, as the final struggle comes to a close. Without commanders, the armies no longer fight, without a port, the navies drift at sea, and without a home, refugees cover the landscape, tearing apart what few nations were not directly brought down by the devastation of nuclear warfare.\n\nWell over half a billion are dead from this great, and possibly last, conflict, and those few experts remaining expect the number to triple in the aftermath, if not worse."
 WORLD.101.a:0 "By God, what have we done?"

 WORLD.104.t:0 "Gods of the North"
 WORLD.104.d:0 "Reports have slowly begun filtering down from movement in the distant communes of Siberia. What it is, really, we can not say, but the fact that any form of news is leaving that region alone has set many to wondering what exactly could be happening. Surely, if the communes are making any kind of stir for the first time in twenty years, it must be in some form important.\n\nReports speak of stirrings from the religious. Those few traders who make their way that far north over the East Siberian trade routes have spoken of entire communes chanting in prayer, of churches being filled to the brim, and of some figure pushing them onward. Nobody knows exactly what has spurred this action, but the people of Siberian keep praying for one man.\n\nThey call him, the Father.\n"
 WORLD.104.a:0 "Nothing but nonsense."

 WORLD.200.t:0 "Mordrel Secures Breton Leadership"
 WORLD.200.d:0 "After reports of increased tensions between the various political forces within Brittany in the wake of the German Civil War, the situation appears to have calmed down. International observers are confirming reports that Olier Mordrel's crackdown on his opponents has resulted in successful counter against the upheaval. Both the extremist wings of the SBB and the democratic hopefuls of the SAV have been, for the time being, silenced.\n\nAs Mordrel is well into his third decade of heading the Breton National Committee, experts everywhere wonder if things will remain as they have since the Congress of Pontivy in 1940, or if Mordrel is finally ready to make his plans a reality."
 WORLD.200.a:0 "How is this news?"
 
 WORLD.201.t:0 "Delaporte Overthrows Breton Government"
 WORLD.201.d:0 "Startling news from Brest, as observers are reporting a democratic takeover of Brittany. Practically a fascist dictatorship since the fall of France, Brittany nevertheless was ruled by the Breton National Committee, from which the democratic forces of the SAV have evidently emerged from.\n\nLead by a man named Raymond Delaporte, the nearly bloodless revolution in Brittany has sent Olier Mordrel into exile, and his henchman Célestin Lainé has been arrested by military forces loyal to Delaporte.\n\nAs a small and democratic nation in Europe, Brittany will certainly face trouble from its neighboring countries, especially Himmler's Burgundian state."
 WORLD.201.a:0 "A new democracy in Europe?"

 WORLD.203.t:0 "Lainé Takes Over Breton Government"
 WORLD.203.d:0 "The international community has finally pieced together the frantic reports coming from Brittany: the national socialist faction of the SBB, lead by Célestin Lainé, has taken control of the nation.\n\nNumerous deaths of the opponents of the Bezen Perrot, which some have called Lainé's personal army, have been reported. Among the casualties is Olier Mordrel, the previous leader of the Breton National Committee, whose cause of death is as of yet unknown.\n\nWith full control of the state, experts fear the bloodshed in Brittany has only begun. A few experts are even preparing for the worst, as Lainé is believed to have connections to Heinrich Himmler's Burgundy."
 WORLD.203.a:0 "Bloody times for Brittany."
 
 WORLD.204.t:0 "Breton Black Market Shut Down"
 WORLD.204.d:0 "In an internationally divisive statement, Raymond Delaporte of Brittany has announced that the infamous Breton black market will be shut down. Something of a public secret, the involvement of the Bretons in the international black market has been known for a long time, but to many, the extent of their operations has come as a shock.\n\nIn his statement, Delaporte takes full responsibility for the suffering the "misguided" practice has brought on the world, and promises to take steps towards redemption. However, scattered reports are already coming in of Breton operatives going rogue in the wake of the news that threatens their livelihood."
 WORLD.204.a:0 "Where are we going to get our guns from now?"
 WORLD.204.b:0 "Good riddance."
 WORLD.204.c:0 "It had to be done."

 WORLD.340.t:0 "The Warsaw Uprising"
 WORLD.340.d:0 "While the Generalgouvernement in Poland has always been quiet, this has seemingly been little more than a thin veneer, desperately kept on by the Germans in the face of growing unrest. This has become evident when, not even weeks after the beginning of the German Civil War, the Polish Home Army, or the AK, has begun a general uprising that has easily toppled the weak Generalgouvernement and its leader, Hans Frank.\n\nWith a free Poland on the very border of the Reich, the future seems unclear for how well the rest of the German sphere will weather this storm. Still, Poland is completely surrounded by the Reich on all borders besides the southern front, where it has some scant access to its rapidly collapsing neighbor in Hungary. One can only guess at the reborn state's future."
 WORLD.340.a:0 "Poland will be ours!"
 WORLD.340.b:0 "The Nazi Empire continues to crumble..."
 WORLD.340.c:0 "Hopefully the other Slavs don't get any ideas..."

 WORLD.341.t:0 "The Verona Conference Opens"
 WORLD.341.d:0 "Since the death of Benito Mussolini, the first duce of Italy and creator of fascism, Italy's commitment to fascism has been fading. And for that today, 1 June 1963, is a historical day for Italy and her people, the winds of change are blowing as the Congress in Verona has been assembled to determine the future direction of Italian Empire.\n\nWhat this direction will be is bound to the conference; the arguments will be made, agreements will be reached, tensions will rise, hostilities will be soften and eventually a pathway for Italian people will be reached. As Duce Ciano makes his opening speech, international observers listen in excitement as one of the largest colonial empires of the world may loosen her iron grip over her subjects and people, or not.

His supporters all around the empire are rallying in the city squares, showing their support for Scorza and his ideas to make the empire strong once again!\n\nNot everybody is happy with this result of course, Duce Ciano himself is clearly disappointed with the result, as his mandate is denied and his power as duce have been questioned by Scorza, more so people that were anticipating for reforms to the empire have to protest even now.

Neither Duce Ciano nor Carlo Scorza managed to get the upper hand, and after realizing the debates are going to no where, both Ciano and Scorza left the congress in frustration. The moment they left, all the congressmen first started to exchange insults, then punches; congress fell to chaos that is more resembling of a bar fight than an assembly to decide the future of one of the greatest nations on Europe.\n\nSupporters of both sides flocked to the streets, to claim superiority over the other which already turned into street brawls.

Fearful of perpetual Hindu domination, the northern Muslim minority has seceeded in its entirety, declaring a new state known as 'Pakistan'.\n\nMigrations to and from Pakistan have begun in earnest across the subcontinent, as have particularly brutal incidents of violence.

 WORLD.655.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the Bulgarian administration has officially cut its ties with Germany, in large part thanks to assistance the Italians lent to the now prominent Fatherland Front. Celebrations were held as the last Germans based in Sofia left the city.\n\nIt was not long after Tsar Simeon II formally signed a treaty aligning Bulgaria with Italy. Although they indeed are an alternative to the Germans, some question if the Tsar has only replaced one overlord with another."

 WORLD.656.d:0 "In a move few were expecting, Tsar Simeon II has declared that Bulgaria would be "...a neutral country; one that refuses to be a battleground between the German and Italian Empires!"\n\nUnsurprisingly, neither power is thrilled about the situation. Both Germany and Italy blame each other for pushing Bulgaria to isolate itself diplomatically, but the reality is that the Tsar played both sides against each other. What happens to Bulgaria now is questionable, but one thing is certain: Bulgaria will be free to decide its own fate."

Under immense pressure from their northern neighbors, the Hungarians had no choice but to concede to German demands to fall back in line.\n\nThe Italians are outraged. Accusing the Germans of instigating political violence and destabilizing the country, their delegations have fallen back to Rome to regroup and plan their next course of action."

An Italian 'puppet state' now lies on their border. As of now, nothing has come of it, but there is no doubt that the Germans are plotting their next move."
 WORLD.658.a:0 "Another traitor exposed! They'll get what's coming to them..."

It is a well known secret that they have been extensively aiding right winged terror groups, notably the Iron Guard. This failure hasn't curbed their enthusiasm, however.

 WORLD.663.d:0 "With already deep preexisting ties to the Reich, the French State has decided to remain with the Pakt.\n\nAlthough the Italians, and frankly, much of the world is shocked by this, the French are nothing if not pragmatic. Any hopes to regain what they lost will require them to work with Germany. Although they may not like it, the agreement is mutually beneficial. The French and Germans will therefore continue to work together for the foreseeable future."

 WORLD.665.d:0 "The French have had enough. Surrounded by ambitious nations with a metaphorical knife behind their backs, the French have taken the third option available to them. That option? Cut ties with their neighbors.\n\nNot even the most skilled geopolitical analysts could have foreseen France isolating themselves. It seemed foolish, reckless even. Yet they've done it, to the surprise of Italy and Germany. No one is really sure what either nation is going to do, but for the foreseeable future, France is the master of her own destiny."

 WORLD.666.d:0 "After what seemed like a colossal effort, Germany has reigned in their rowdy subject. Facing opposition from the collaboration government, refugee riots, Italian interference and a massive surge in partisan activity, the Germans stand victorious in Serbia.\n\nWith the refugee crisis dying down, and local partisans running out of momentum, Serbia is once again firmly under Germany's thumb. Whether this is subject to change remains to be seen."
 WORLD.666.a:0 "Our holdings are secure!"
 WORLD.666.b:0 "Damn the Germans!"

 WORLD.667.t:0 "Serbia Sides With Italy"
 WORLD.667.d:0 "The Italians have secured Serbia!\n\nBy riling up the locals, combined with winning the hearts and minds of the disenfranchised refugees and Serbian nationalists, the country has managed to push out its German occupiers.\n\nDeeming the costs simply too high to justify keeping a presence, the Germans have decided to withdraw from what they call "worthless cesspool". Cesspool or not, the Italian victory has shaken things up in the Balkans, and is a big loss for the Reich."
 WORLD.667.a:0 "They weren't worth the effort anyway."
 WORLD.667.b:0 "A great victory!"
 WORLD.667.c:0 "Check, Germany."

 WORLD.668.t:0 "Serbia Goes Into Isolation"
 WORLD.668.d:0 "The situation in Serbia has become grim. Refugees are stranded and hungry, partisans raid with impunity, and what government there was has fallen into chaos.\n\nInstead of Germany or Italy winning decisive victories and cementing their respective influences, their meddling has only made the dire situation in Serbia worse. Both sides have decided to cut their loses for now, and both have unofficially agreed to leave Serbia alone as a neutral territory while what remains of the government attempts to solve their many, many issues."

 WORLD.669.d:0 "Dramatic - although perhaps not surprising - news has arrived from what few diplomatic staff and foreign correspondents work in Southern and Central Africa these days. The Grossafrikaner Reichsstaat, a rogue amalgamation of Germany's African colonies, has collapsed completely. After a general breakdown in commerce and civil authority, numerous warlords, militias, and would-be states have declared their independence from the central government in Quelimane. The Reichsstaat's ruler, the dreaded Hans Hüttig, is presumed dead. Meanwhile, German settlers, soldiers, and administrative staff are desperately fleeing the continent any way they can. From the Congo Sea to the Zambezi River, Africa is free from the German jackboot. But nobody knows what will come next."

 WORLD.701.desc:0 "In a surprise turn of events, the Democratic Party, thought to have been long extinguished as a major political force, has come crashing back into power. Wallace F. Bennett, of the Republican-Democrats, today won a narrow victory against the National Progressive Party to become president of the United States. Bennett utilized his acceptance speech to call on a bitterly divided America to join together as one nation to face down the struggles of the day.\n\nMild-mannered and averse to political extremes, Bennett believes that a middle ground between both sides of the civil rights debate is possible. He has also promised to expand America's diplomatic and economic outreach with fellow OFN partners and other neutral nations, breaking from the cloak-and-dagger approach of the Nixon administration."

 WORLD.702.desc:0 "Following a close political race that for the first time saw the incumbent Republican-Democrats at great risk of losing the reins of power, the party today breathed a sigh of relief as Republican nominee Lyndon B. Johnson achieved victory in the presidential election. In his victory speech, Johnson praised the continuing endurance of his party, and vowed to carry on the good work of his predecessors.\n\nBullish but progressively-minded, Johnson shares the conviction of former President Kennedy towards the cause of civil rights. Insider voices claim he has some sort of grand project in the works, aimed at improving numerous areas of American society, but Johnson remains tight-lipped for the time being. Some political rivals have called him a stubborn bully, though many within the Center-NPP have quietly praised some of his electoral platform."

Kennedy, from the center wing of the National Progressive Party, today clinched a narrow victory over the Republican-Democrats to become the next president. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy earnesty thanked the American people for putting their trust in him, and promised that he would prove that this trust was well placed.\n\nThe brother of former President John F. Kennedy, Bobby has vowed to honor his brother's legacy by championing the cause of civil rights even further, and to address the issues of poverty and income inequality to create a better and fairer America for everyone. Cynics believe him to be too bold and idealistic to succeed, but millions of Americans earnestly believe him to be the man who can change America."

George Wallace, nominee for the far-right faction of the National Progressive Party, has narrowly won the presidency after one of the most contentious and least civil election races in American history. As a triumphant Wallace gave his acceptance speech, he proudly declared that "the American people have called out in one united voice, and they make one simple demand - stop this nonsense at once!"\n\nNobody can fail to interpret the target of these words, as the segregationist candidate has run on a platform of staunch opposition to the previously ascendant civil rights movement. Renewed clashes between segregationists and civil rights activists have broken out across the South, and Martin Luther King and other prominent voices have condemned the sudden reactionary turn of events."

Barry Goldwater today took the oath of office, declaring in his inauguration speech that the time of overbearing and irresponsible government was over.\n\nA vocal critic of federal government policy for many years, Goldwater believes that Washington's budget and powers should be rolled back heavily, and that any responsibilities not directly pertaining to defense and diplomacy should be delegated to state governments. However, he also believes in diverting funding to America's growing military-industrial complex, so as to better protect against the other powers. Some, however, shudder at collaboration between 'war profiteers' and the government."

He has vowed to push America forward in the Space Race, promising massive funding increases to NASA and elaborated on extravagant mission plans to once and for all put America ahead of the fascists in the realm above. Critics call him an idealist who intends to throw away money on unnecessary passion projects, but many others cheer on his bold vision, and hope that he might usher America, and the world, into a new age of science."

Having written extensively on the subject in his time as an activist, Harrington finally has the chance to let the voice of the "Other America" be heard.

In Germany and Japan, the news was met with silent anxiety, as Smith has often called for retribution upon America's enemies. Now, she wields the sword, and if and where it strikes will determine the future of the world."

A fiery speech it was, as well, calling the American government incompetent and proclaiming that its fat would be trimmed away such the nation would be great once more.\n\nMcNamara himself is well known for his cold, hard practicality. Disillusioned with American politics, he garnered support under the guise of cutting down on wasteful government spending and reallocating those funds to the military.

The speech has been met with praise both in the States and abroad. Germany and Japan, in particular, seem pleased that such a peaceable man has come into office.\n\nExperts believed that the flames of American revanchism burned too brightly for a McGovern victory, but it appears that they were wrong. With his message of peace, McGovern plans to create a new League of Nations and reopen trade with America's enemies.

Giving a hopeful but somewhat fiery speech in front of thousands of onlookers at the National Mall, the new president called for an end to extremism and continued American protection of liberty.\n\nThe address has been praised in the OFN, but less so in Germany and least of all in Japan. It was also poorly received by the more extreme elements of the NPP, notably the L-NPP and the Yockeys. Regardless, it appears America will not embrace extremism for the sake of survival, as a new, progressive president steps up. Few expect Jackson to truly act upon his threats towards the Germans and Japanese. Most seem to believe that his administration will just prove to be another four years of American posturing.

She continues to advocate the 'Kirkpatrick Doctrine', which calls for intervention in third-world countries in order to stop the spread of anti-American interests.\n\nNow, many nations in Latin America are worried that, as happened with the infamous Roosevelt Corollary, the United States will once again begin breathing down their necks. Similarly, Germany and Japan are standing vigilant, unwilling to surrender their gains to an iron-willed America.

Joy, rage, hope, and hatred: calling the global reaction 'controversial' may well be the understatement of the decade. In the Nazi-dominated regions of Europe, the news was met with an extremely positive response, as many were happy to see such a likeminded individual be sworn in. In the OFN and Japan the news was met somewhat less well, with many now wary of a new, militant America. It was most divisive in the United States, with many protests evolving into riots by nightfall.\n\nRegardless of the reactions, Yockey now sits in the Oval Office.

There, a new plan was drafted to create a joint occupation regime in the North African country, effectively turning it into an Italian-Iberian condominium with Messali Hadj, known campaigner for peace in Algeria, as its nominal head.\n\nDespite being painted as a way to preserve peace, the Algerian Mandate is a very controversial solution to the crisis, as many in the FLN consider it a thinly veiled act of imperialism and pied-noir and other European settlers lament that the new mandate will not protect them from native terrorism. Still, the peace seems to hold on for now, most likely kept together by the lucrative oil deals that have just been approved between Iberia and Italy.\n"

Divided by foreign settlers from both Iberia and Italy, the area has been left in a state best described as anarchic. This is poised to change, after recent events.\n\nAfter a conflict in the partitioned colony, it would appear that the Iberian settlers have claimed victory and wrested control of the entire country from both previous owners. The new Algerian state, led by the infamous pied-noir Yves Sérac, has announced, in its gratitude, the cession of the area around the city of Oran to the Iberian Union.\n\nInternational observers label this as a decisive show of Iberian military prowess, or at least an Italian lack of preparation."

These actions of Ciano, while surprising to the uninitiated, are the culmination of the long decay of fascism in Italy that began before the death of Mussolini. This decay was, undoubtedly, accelerated by Ciano, who sought to dissolve the old system as he saw that it would only bring ruin to Italy given time.\n\nWhile there are still those in Italy who oppose this, Ciano's victory at the Verona Conference gave him the necessary mandate to ignore and sideline his opponents, leaving very little official opposition to his implementation of democracy. The Italian people now prepare for their first elections in decades, and it is already obvious that there is much excitement throughout Italy at the prospect.

Owing their triumph to the division and infighting in the Arab camp, Irgun however is now in control of a vast region populated by an Arab majority bitterly opposed to Jewish rule.

While partisan and resistance activity still continues in the mountains, the Italian government has been forced to formally capitulate after its armed forces were reduced to shambles by the German war machine. As panzers were rolling into Rome, the Italian government was overthrown by a small group of pro-German fascist hardliners, who have declared the creation of the Italian Social Republic.\n\nTheoretically an independent government, the social republic is de facto a German puppet state, led by the most infamous of pro-German lackeys - Roberto Farinacci. Allowing and supporting German occupation of the country, Farinacci's government clearly only exists thanks to German boots stomping on Italian soil, and the newly installed duce has already declared the restoration of "eternal friendship and brotherhood" between Italy and Germany. Yet another country has fallen to Göring's armies, and now, the Führer's rule extends over all of Europe. The world can only pray that this is enough to satisfy his ambitions...\n"

This morning, armed blackshirts seized the king's residence, taking him and the royal family as hostages, while the duce proclaimed the birth of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, a republican state close to the ideals of the original fascists.\n\nAccording to some reports, there have already been limited clashes between Regio Esercito and MVSN units loyal to Scorza and pro-monarchy units, as the new republican government has ordered numerous officers arrested and units disarmed. The situation in the country is confused and rapidly changing, but it seems like the duce is on his way to fully close his grip on the country once and for all, and the proclamation of the republic is yet another step in his projects.\n"

While this is not the first terrorist attack that has occurred in the country since its return to democracy, it is the most deadly yet, and certainly the one most shocking for the public opinion, as it struck in the heart of Italy's second-largest city.\n\nWhile the government promised a quick investigation that will deliver the terrorists to justice, in truth the motives and perpetrators of the bombing are shrouded in mystery - however, the most probable culprits seem to be a gang of radical anarchists based in Milan. This event has only contributed to the ferocious political clashes happening every day on the italian streets between striking workers, policemen, student groups and even neo-fascist organizations - many are beginning to lose hope in Italy's nascent democracy, and some even speculate that this is only the start of a long period of violence and terror in the country.\n"

While only containing few probes to conduct experiments on long range radio communication in the upper atmosphere, San Marco 1 was designed largely as a test for Italy's capabilities to launch spacecraft into orbit.\n\nDespite the relatively small scientific importance of San Marco 1, especially when compared to the much more developed German, American and Japanese space programs, the success of the endeavour was viewed as a major symbolic victory by Italy, which became the first non-superpower to successfully perform a space launch.\n"

The population, dissatisfied by economic stagnation, oppression of civil liberties, persecution of minorities, and the continuous wars of aggression waged by the fascist regime, has risen up. Faced with brutal repression, many have taken to the mountains, from where partisan units have begun to wage an insurgency.\n\nPartisans have not only taken up residence in the far fringes of the empire, like Albania and Tunisia, but also mountainous regions in the Alps and the Apennines where partisans have begun to use the difficult terrain to their advantage. Several regions are already hotbeds of insurgency, with some areas even organizing themselves as 'partisan republics'. Repression from the Italian Armed Forces is already underway and it seems like Rome still has the situation firmly under control, but for how long, none know.\n"

As local partisan groups are more active than ever in both Italy proper and in the outskirts of the empire, the tension seems close to a breaking point. A small insurgent group called Most Serene Venetian Army has managed to pull off a spectacular occupation of San Marco Square in Venice, driving an impromptu homemade tank through one of Italy's most famous landmarks.\n\nFrom the San Marco bell tower, the group unfurled Venetian flags and read a message demanding the restoration of democracy and the creation of a federal Italian state, with strong local authorities capable of stopping fascistic encroachment on civil liberties. After an intervention by special forces, the group's members were all arrested or killed, and peace was restored - but for how long?\n"

While some rumors imply that Scorza did this as a result of strong internal pressure coming from the PFR, the duce has officially declared that with his extensive reforms now complete, he has the duty to allow the fascist system he perfected to finally operate as it was always intended to.\n\nIn his years in office, the duce has enforced onto Italy a version of fascism closer to early versions of the movement, by enacting sweeping reforms aimed at creating 'organic democracy' and 'socialized economy', as well as of course removing the royal house and turning Italy into a social republic. While many of Scorza's reforms have had outright catastrophic effects in many regards and a strong insurgency still exists in the republic, the PFR is still the only political force capable of controlling the country - at least for now.\n"

The kidnappers have not yet issued demands, but it is certain that they are part of one of Italy's many extremist terrorist groups.\n\nThe news of the kidnapping was enough to throw the entirety of Italian politics into utter panic. Already, emergency talks are going on at a feverish pace between political parties, law enforcements, and even the royal court, all struggling and arguing about how to respond to the happenings. What's worse, the fact that a terrorist group was able to enact such a spectacular action in broad daylight was enough to further spread the paranoia and terror which has already taken grip of much of Italian society.\n"

 novel.1.d:0 ""Heirs of Babylon" is a newly released fiction book detailing an 'alternative' universe in which the Third Reich lost its struggle against the decadent capitalist West and the mongrel states of Russia after our beloved Führer was cut down by a sniper's bullet in 1935. Written by Cornish author Antony Beevor, "Heirs of Babylon" details the lives of people living in divided Berlin, Londium, Alexandria, and Philadelphia - the new capital of the Americas. Much of the world is divided between the Imperial Dominion of Britannia, who have reclaimed their traditional thrones in Germany and France; the United American Federation whose borders stretch from the North Pole to the South Pole; and the insidious pan-Eurasian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nFerdinand Featherston is an investigator, a Britannian detective with a licence to kill and beholden only to Her Britannic Majesty. Searching for his wife in red Europe, he is swept up by a world-shaking plot in Berlin. The chase takes him to America, France, Africa and finally to Gibraltar in a series of daring escapes and high-speed gun battles.\n\nThe crux of the novel's events is the Gibraltar Missile Crisis, a tense nuclear standoff between the dominion and the pan-Eurasian union, while the United Federation seeks to undermine both sides and provoke a war for their own purposes.\nThe novel ends in uncertainty, with tanks massing across the Gibraltar border and an American fleet refusing to answer hails circling like vultures.

 novel.2.t:0 "The Greatest Story Never Told"
 novel.2.d:0 "A rather interesting alternate history novel has been gaining some attention around the world, perhaps for all the wrong reasons.\n\n"The Greatest Story Never Told", released two weeks ago, self published by a certain "Bodean Clefton Dixie" (almost certainly a pen name), with a hand drawn cover, which some critics described as "a crude drawing of a tank with a Dixie flag, rolling over a Nazi flag with a hammer and sickle instead of a swastika, within a thought balloon coming out of George Lincoln Rockwell's head".\n\nThe novel is a strange ramble about how if Rockwell hadn't been assassinated "by Judeo-Bolsheviks" he would have created "the greatest story in mankind's history" and goes on to blame his death on "Jews being afraid of what truths he could write".\n\nThe novel has garnered attention, all due to its bizarre tone and claims such as: "Nazi Germany being a Judeo-Bolshevik bastion" due to it being "led by a party who is socialist before it is nationalist" among many other... astonishing claims, which are surprisingly comedic, hence its widespread success in the U.S., and abroad."

 novel.3.t:0 "The Man in the Iron Fortress"
 novel.3.d:0 "Science fiction author Phillip K. Dick has released his latest novel, named "The Man in the Iron Fortress." A work of speculative alternate history, the novel takes place in a dystopian world where communism reigns supreme. The 'point of divergence' in the story's history is that the socialist politician Eugene Debs remained with the Democrats, becoming president in 1920. As a result, he supported the nascent Soviet Union and the May Fourth movement in China. Debs' beliefs died with him in 1926, and his successor Robert La Follette proved to be far more isolationist, a trend that dominated American politics for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became dominated by the authoritarian Felix Dzerzhinsky, while the communists under Mao Tse-tung were able to unite China and counter-invade the Japanese. When the Nazis rose to power, they were able to crush the unsupported Allied nations of Europe, but were unprepared for a surprise Soviet invasion and were swiftly defeated. In 1947, a joint Sino-Soviet army invaded America, leading to them dividing the country north-south.\n\nThe novel is set within occupied America and follows a wide cast of characters, from a Cheka spy to a Chinese official obsessed with American cowboy culture. At the center of its plot is a book called "The Beast Among the Reeds," which tells of a world where both Nazism and communism were defeated. The political backdrop is one of rapidly decaying Sino-Soviet relations; Dzerzhinsky is succeeded after his death by the even more totalitarian Lavrentiy Beria, and the threat of nuclear war looms on the horizon.\n\nDespite the novel's criticism for seemingly unrealistic developments (the Soviets allegedly drained the Baltic Sea for farmland and built a giant bridge stretching across the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska), Dick has defended the action as being plausible within the best available information he could acquire at the time. That still hasn't stopped the book from becoming a bestseller in the United States and Canada, and it has already been nominated for a Hugo Award."

 novel.4.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles"
 novel.4.d:0 "Earlier this month, noted author and founder of Gonzo journalism Hunter S. Thompson released his newest book, "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles". Set in a surreal alternate history universe with few rules, the work is a multi-pronged satire on other, more serious alternate history works, as well as a scathing critique of the culture of the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThompson spends dozens of pages going into the minutia of each "divergence point", off-color vignettes within the overarching story that detail how the world of this novel ended up differing from our own. Irreverent and often nonsensical, these stories detail ridiculous episodes, such as a Japanese doctor in Unit 731 accidentally trying a hallucinogenic drug of his own concoction, leading him to paradrop an army of drugged-up "ghouls" into downtown Tokyo. While critics are somewhat split on these stories, casual readers tired of the over-saturation of the fiction market with cheap, overly-serious, 'alt-history' novels have found them a welcome, if odd, diversion from the norm.\n\nLinking these various episodes together, Thompson has strung out a vague semblance of a plot in this alternate LA, mainly consisting of cheap allegories to attack contemporary American political culture. In one memorable scene, a street gang closely modeled after the Yockeyites beat up a demonstration of "old yuppie bigots" (Nixon supporters, also referred to as "bloodthirsty freaks"), all while an inebriated Thompson watches with juvenile glee.\n\nWhile critics and readers alike are split on the novel, most at least concede it is a scathing and effective critique of the current literary and political climate."

 novel.5.d:0 "Since the fall of London, novelist Eric Blair, better known by his pen name George Orwell, has gained prominence from his political writings done in exile in Canada. Today, he has released his most lengthy opus: the last chapter in his "Legacy of the Weltkrieg" alternate history series, "The Red Twilight". The series takes place in a timeline that diverges from ours with a Central Powers victory in the First World War, and has received critical attention for its allegorical deconstruction of our world.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Entente, the governments of the British Empire and France quickly collapse and are replaced by socialist republics, while Russia eventually becomes a fascistic dictatorship lead by White revolutionary Boris Savinkov. After unifying to destroy the German Empire, her allies, and the remnants of the Entente, the alliance quickly shatters, with the libertarian syndicalist Commune of France and Oswald Mosley's Union of Britain forging their own internationals and engaging in an apocalyptic nuclear war that leaves Europe and North America in ruins, while Russia and Japan engage in a similarly destructive schism. The world by 1962 is devastated by nuclear fallout and divided by a four-sided armistice threatening to either end civilization or enslave it under various flavours of totalitarianism.\n\nEnding with the 'English socialist' American Commonwealth tearing apart itself into a Third American Civil War as white supremacists revolt in the South, the novel has received analysis for its complex parallels with the violent conflicts occurring all around world, though some dismiss it as no different than the rest of the glut of alt-history novels that have been filling bookshelves in the recent years. Responding to critics, Orwell has addressed the implausibility of this universe by writing "... this universe is no less stranger than anything that has happened in ours for the last half-century.""

 novel.10.d:0 "The novel "Another Planet's Hell" has released today, giving its author, Aldous Huxley, quite the reputation for its themes and story. The book is set in an alternative reality, where Adolf Hitler dies during his attempted putsch in 1923 and never takes power, instead superseded by the monarchist DNVP and its leader, Alfred Hugenberg. In Russia, Nikolai Bukharin loses to Joseph Stalin, who centralizes power and creates an almost nightmarish dictatorship that strengthens the union. The Second World War is is started by the newly formed Deutsche Ordennsstaat, a military junta backed by the Kaiser, and is led by Hugenberg, Erwin Rommel and Erich Ludendorff (in the book, the junta is called the Crusader's Council).\n\nThe book takes place during the war, in occupied France. Its protagonist, Anne-Marie Manouchian, starts as a college professor teaching chemistry, but becomes a bombmaker after the school is shut down and many of its professors arrested for promoting anti-German ideals. During her struggle, she meets the two other primary protagonists; Jack, an OSS agent helping the resistance, and Nikolai, a Soviet agent running guns to communist militias. As the story goes on, the three primary factions emerge; first, the Imperial Entente, a faction led by a more reactionary United Kingdom and a Bonapartist France. Second, the Alliance of Soviets, a Russia-led faction poised at spreading world communism. Finally, there exists the Pacific Joint-Defense Group, an alliance led by a more democratic Japan and the United States.\n\nThe book ends with Anne-Marie witnessing the nuclear bombing of the city of Dresden, while Nikolai says that "this is not an end, but a beginning to a world torn open by flame. Your children shall be communists, or you shall not have children." The book has been criticized by many as being overly pessimistic and heavy on details, but others have insisted that this could have been a reality had things played out differently. Huxley has defended the novel, saying that "as miserable as things are, we can at least be thankful for what could never happen.""

 novel.11.d:0 "An intriguing work of fiction has been gaining traction around the world in the past few weeks. Said novel, titled "The Blue Order," authored under the pen name of "Miles Lloyd" depicts a world in which a radical, authoritarian politician runs for the American Presidency in 1932, associated with the revived "Bull Moose Party." This president, only known to readers as "the president," quickly proceeds to consolidate his power under the guise of defending America, and rapidly turns the American economy into one fueled by preparation for an 'eventual war'. With this in mind, he issues an ultimatum to Nazi Germany upon the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936. Any further military movements will be met with swift American reprisal. Upon the Anschluss of Austria, the president declares war on Germany, under the guise of "safeguarding liberty".\n\nHistory is then lost in this world for two decades. Upon sunrise of some arbitrary day, the world is revealed to have been torn apart by a Second World War. In Russia, the Soviets have lost all of Eastern Siberia to the American Republic, while the death of Bukharin throws the remainder into chaos. In Asia, the State of Japan lies under American supervision, having lost against them prior. In Europe, the British Isles, Iberia, and Italy remain as the last major independent regions, having formed a strange alliance of democracy and fascism, with the Soviets being a previous member before Bukharin's death. In the remains of mainland Europe, American puppet 'republics' sit under lock and chain. American control is not absolute, however, with various warlord states waiting for the sunset to liberate their homelands.\n\nThe president cannot live forever, however, and upon his assassination at the end of the novel, the sun begins crossing the horizon, as the destiny of humanity hangs in the balance."

 novel.12.t:0 "The Occupation"
 novel.12.d:0 "A new book has been flying off the shelves across the world, circulating heavily even in the black markets of Germany. Entitled "The Occupation", the book describes an alternate history where the Germans are defeated in the Second World War. In it, Japan collapses into civil war with communists and lose their footholds on mainland Asia. Though the emperor eventually prevails, Japan never recovers and opts to lick its wounds rather than embark on the conquests it did in our world. Thus, once the Germans are pushing across England and the United States finally intervenes, they are not distracted by the fighting in the Pacific and manage to defeat and occupy Germany. The defeated Reich is split into two halves: the German People's Republic, a Soviet puppet state consisting of the north, and the Republic of Germany, an allied occupation zone with self-government consisting of the south, the Rhineland, and Austria. The two are more commonly known as North and South Germany in the story. Once again, a nationalist and revanchist government is elected in South Germany, similar to Hitler's rise in our own world. Having learned from the mistakes of the past, South Germany is quickly invaded and the old government reinstated by the Allies. The story follows a poor German youth who is believed to be a nationalist by the occupying Western powers. Although he isn't at the start of the book, his unjustified persecution by the occupiers eventually leads him to become one, and the book hints that this is part of an endless cycle that will always lead to oppression and violence by one side. It also hints that something similar and far more dangerous may occur with the now-recovered Japan.\n\nThe book has proven stunningly controversial. Many claim it is Nazi schlock, trying to clear them of wrongdoing and insinuating that their reaction to Versailles was justified. Others claim that it is simply unrealistic, and that Japan's communist movement would have never been strong enough to do the damage the book has them do. The author says they are all missing the point, and that the book is more about the message rather than the setting."

The novel takes place in an alternate history where Mikhail Tukhachevsky launches a coup against Bukharin in the late 1920s, transforming the Soviet Union into a military state comparable to Napoleon's France. 'The New Bonaparte' as he is styled, launches numerous invasions of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia at a time when the rest of the world is still reeling from the Great Depression and unable to respond, significantly strengthening the Soviets' position. Hitler's Germany finds a much tougher opponent in this union and the war between the two lasts for many years, until both sides are forced into peace after each discovers the atomic bomb simultaneously and the cities of Königsberg and Kiev are annihilated.\n\nThe story focuses on a commissar of the Red Army who has been assigned to oversee the reconstruction of Soviet-held Königsberg, now rechristened Stalingrad after a close ally of Tukhachevsky. Upon discovering the murder of a prominent government official, the commissar finds himself embroiled in a byzantine web of plots involving the Soviet high command, the local garrison, and partisans from the heavily oppressed and radiation-scarred German inhabitants of the city. Hints are laid throughout the story of greater goings on behind the scenes, such as massive instability in German-controlled Western Europe and extensive Soviet military campaigns in Northern Iran and Western China. The story ends with the commissar narrowly escaping death at the hands of his superiors and uncovering a plot to provoke the Reich into a new war.\n\nThe book has drawn praised for its unique take on the noir genre and its gritty setting amidst the burned-out streets of Stalingrad. Some have criticised it for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the German characters, with a few even going as far as to suggest that Deighton may possess Nazi ideals. Regardless, it has already had a quite successful first run of sales and is expected to become a staple of alternate history for years to come."

To commemorate the final victory over the last remnants of resistance, massive celebrations in honor of Supreme Leader Safa Gaziz were held across the country. Waves of Slavic refugees, as well as Gaziz's political opponents, are attempting to escape Kazakhstan to avoid the fate of their less fortunate countrymen who were caught by the Blueshirts.\n\nHaving accomplishing his messianic quest as the father of a purified Kazakh state, Gaziz doesn't think his mission has come to an end.

A land of anarchy before, Kazakhstan is now a territory governed not by artificial human rules, but by the laws sent by God himself.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Kazakhstan shows little concern with the affairs of the sinful earth and have decided to turn themselves to isolationism, away from the temptations of the foreign world.

The Order has proven able to enjoy tremendous success in their campaign of unification, despite the odds being heavily stacked against them.

The Decembrists rose to power with the election of their leader, Dmitry Likhachev, as Pasternak's successor, and seek to cultivate democratic elitism. While this has resulted in some criticism from the lower classes in society and political opponents, the republican ideals have been upheld so far. After all, this might be the only chance Russia has to become a stable and prospering democracy.\n"

 WORLD.1144.desc:0 "In a strange turn of events, the windswept taiga of the Russian Far East is now reportedly under the control of the forces of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, founder of the Russian Fascist Party. While the idea of Russians embracing fascism may seem bizarre, many analysts point to the RFP's key role in the All-Russian Expeditionary Force as a precedent.\n\nWhat comes next for Rodzaevsky's regime is uncertain. Logically, the RFP will probably begin a push into Siberia proper in an effort to unify Russia. How this so-called Vozhd and his followers will interact with the international system is uncertain. Although the RFP and Rodzaevsky have long enjoyed the patronage of Japanese backers, his vision of a fascist Russia is clearly closer to the German model considering his party's virulent anti-Semitism and his extensive usage of Nazi iconography. The consequences of this development remain to be seen.\n"

In the east, David Stirling and his militarists have seized power, declaring that the socialist Left Resistance was responsible for the death of Auchinleck, establishing what is known as the English Protectorate to preserve English sovereignty. In the west, Orde Wingate leads the remnants of the liberals and socialists in the English Free State, who are aligning towards the OFN.

Mr. and Mrs. Hewel were reported missing two weeks prior to their discovery, after their home in an upscale Cologne neighborhood had been broken into.\n\nA terrorist group known as the Red Army Faction has taken responsibility for the killings, citing suppression and tyrannical action by Führer Bormann's administration as their justification. This turn of events has thrown the German Reich into turmoil, with weeks of violent protests across the Reich having been put down just days before the kidnapping of the minister and his wife."

 WORLD.17004.desc:0 "With the Oil Crisis and its economic effects rippling through the world, the Greater Germanic Reich was hit particularly badly by it as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange dropped by over one hundred points. Thousands have already been laid off and several businesses appear on the road to insolvency.\n\nEconomists were quick to note that the Reich's dependency on oil massively increased due to vast industrialization efforts under the Zollverein, particularly in Eastern Europe.\n\nFührer Speer has yet to publically react to this crisis. As economic reform was the main pillar of his reform policy, the abrupt fizzling out of the so-called 'wirtschaftswunder' that took shape under the guidance of Reichswirtschaftsminister Ludwig Erhard is sure to take a massive toll on public approval."

The party's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, gave a concise speech in Baghdad where he reaffirmed the party's intentions to rule in harmony with all of Iraq's population.\n\nBased on the concepts of a semi-democratic political system meant to promote Islamic values and ethics, Ad-Dawa was incredibly popular amongst Iraq's Shiite population, a popularity which only grew as al-Khoei assumed leadership over the party and called for a democratic and tolerant Islamic government. While more hardline voices wonder just how tolerance might contain the very real threat of nationalism and Iraq's Sunni population braces for waves of discrimination, al-Khoei has not balked away from the challenges but assured his supporters that a rightful and just government will hold on to the reigns of power, and strive towards the benefit of all Iraqis."

The loyalist forces under President Getúlio Vargas Jr. have announced on the aftermath of the events that "An instability worse than the 30's has been casted upon the nation," as the last mutinied soldiers surrender in the state of Guanabara.\n\nA state of emergency is in place at the moment, with Congress being adjourned "Until all the putschists and the radical right-wing elements are neutralized," as Brazil braces for what seems to be a new dictatorship, albeit a civilian one, as the infamous "National Security Tribunal" is reinstated under the watchful eyes of Leonel Brizola and Professor Bayard Demarie Boiteaux."
WORLD.30001.a: "Hopefully democracy survives this time around."

WORLD.30002.t: "The Canal Riots"
WORLD.30002.desc: "Across Panama rioters have taken to the streets to protest after a tussle between Canal Zone Guards and students of Balboa High School resulted in the tearing of the school's Panamanian Flag. While it's unknown who tore it, both sides pinned the blame on one another, causing further resentment. As the riots came to a boiling point, many wondered how long it would take until they would get someone killed. Then a shot was heard a country over as Ascanio Arosemena, a 19-year-old student, was shot as he was helping to evacuate wounded protesters, and would prove to be the first of many "Martyrs". The international response has been one of disgust at American actions, with Japan in particular showing outrage at America's "Hypocrisy" with the Canal Zone. Responses from the rest of Latin America have been equally critical, with Columbia's ambassador to America stating "In Panama there exists today another Paris Wall"."

WORLD.30003.t: "The Canal War"
WORLD.30003.desc: "Many had hoped that the riots of January 1964 would end the bloodshed over the Canal, and what would become known as Martyrs Day in Panama would stand as the beginning of understanding and diplomacy over the contested Canal Zone.\n\nThis has been proven to be horribly, horribly wrong.\n\nAs Panamanian soldiers march into the Canal Zone, the United States has prepared their forces for a swift invasion into the Isthmus to restore order to the Panama Canal. At the same time, Japanese equipment has seemingly been finding their ways into Panamanian hands, and it seems unlikely that the Rising Sun's support will end there. Although there are many that believe Panama will share the same fate as Guyana, it's people remain undetered, as this might be the only shot they'll get to unite their country.\n\n"

WORLD.30004.desc: "Today representatives from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama have met within the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City to sign off on the formation of CAFTO.\n\nBeing the brainchild of Panamanian president Arnulfo Arias, CAFTO stands as a new economic alliance based around Central American solidarity and further regional integration. While the Japanese and Germans have seemingly taken full advantage of the new buisness partner, the Americans have turned a cold shoulder to the new economic bloc, offering timid praise in it's place. Whether or not CAFTO will succeed in any of it's goals, or accumulate even a fraction of the capital larger economic blocs have remain to be seen, but Arias and the rest of Central America seem willing to give this new experiment a shot."

WORLD.30005.t: "Military Coup in Brazil"
WORLD.30005.d: "Shocking news has come from Brazil where the military has dissolved the legislature and appointed one of their own as President of Brazil. Stating the recent chaotic events that have taken place in Brazil, the military has used this as a pretext to conduct the military coup.\n\nProtests that arose after the coup d'état have been quickly suppressed and beaten back, while prominent opposition leaders have either been arrested or have fled the country. Ex-President Henrique Lott has also been arrested and detained for attempting to rally officers within the military to enact a counter-coup and restore the legislature.\n\nWhile the Military has stated that they will only be in charge of an emergency government, and will restore democracy as soon as it is feasibly possible. However many wonder whether this is simply just a lie.\n\n"

WORLD.30006.d: "Architect Fernando Belaúnde Terry, leader of the Acción Popular - one half of the AP-DC coalition - has obtained victory in the recent Peruvian elections by making sweeping promises of ''popular cooperation'' and ''reconquering Peru for the Peruvians''.\n\nBut not all is well for the new President. He now presides over a divided parliament in which his coalition lacks the majority it would need to push its legislation through. Worse yet, the APRA remains a threat in the northern regions of his country. Needless to say, the new President has his work cut out for him."
WORLD.30006.a: "Good luck architect Belaúnde!"

WORLD.30007.t: "Manuel Seoane Corrales becomes the President of Peru"
WORLD.30007.d: "Manuel Seoane of the populist PP has been elected President of Peru in a highly-contested election. But his victory, far from uniting the Peruvian people behind him, is a harbinger of further instability: opposition parties have declared the election fraudulent, factions of the military want him to resign, and investors are threatening to leave the country en masse.\n\nDifficult times await the Peruvian people as Seoane tries to cement his power."

WORLD.30008.d: "A semblance of calm returns to Peru as Manuel Odria, a former President and the current leader of the UNO, reënters the Government Palace in Lima once more as the victor of the recent Peruvian election.\n\nAn authoritarian, he plans to fight all threats to the democratic system with a firm hand and an iron fist, in particular groups such as the APRA, which he is known to hate with a passion."
WORLD.30008.a: "Let's see what Odria can do this time!"

WORLD.30009.t: "Pedro Beltran Espantoso becomes the President of Peru"
WORLD.30009.d: "A surprise result out of Lima today as the widely-detested Beltran is declared victor in the recent Peruvian election. An economically liberal conservative, he served as Prime Minister and minister for the economy in the Ugarteche government, wherein he earned the hatred of countless Peruvians.\n\nExactly how he will manage to govern Peru amidst this hostile atmosphere is anyone's guess."

WORLD.30010.t: "Bustamante y Rivero becomes the President of Peru"
WORLD.30010.d: "Bustamante, a former President of Peru, returns once again to the Government Palace in Lima as the new President. During his previous term he successfully drove the APRA back from the halls of power in the Battle for Lima; however, his presidency was also marred by the machinations of General Manuel Odria.\n\nAs a result of the latter incident, Bustamante had to overcome a power struggle in the ACDN to win the nomination; now that he is victorious, his labors will be watched with interest by every Peruvian."

WORLD.30011.t: "Brazil's Hundred Days"
WORLD.30011.d: "An unexpected development in Brazil's current constitutional crisis has occurred today. Army commanders led by General Silvio Frota have issued an ultimatum to the legislature to end the current anarchy ‘within the next hundred days'. Implicit in the army's command is the threat of a military intervention, were the civilian leaders to fail in solving the crisis.\n\nThe republic left headless after the resignations of President Lott following a corruption scandal over the Trans Amazonian highway, and the following resignation of Vice President Quadros following the acception of a resignation letter. What began as an attempt by Vice-President Quadros to seize power has turned into the gravest constitutional crisis since the end of Vargas' dictatorship. Brazilians of all political stripes have called for their leaders to end their clash before the generals run out of patience."

WORLD.30017.d: "After being held for the last 9 months in the Devoto Federal Prison in Buenos Aires over charges of incitement of insurrection, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, one of the main actors in the success of the Cuban Revolution, has been released over mounting issues regarding the validity of the charges against him, the release was negotiated by John William Cooke, the leader of the Peronist Movement in Argentina in the absence of their namesake founder.\n\nBeing received to the cheers of a crowd of his sympathizers, Guevara refused to take any interviews and soon departed, it is believed he could be headed to Uruguay over pressure placed on him by the Argentinian government. His current goals are unknown, but the news have had a mixed reception overall, some worry what the revolutionary might have planned with his newfound freedom."
WORLD.30017.a: "Worrysome."

WORLD.30018.t: "The Punta del Este Meeting"
WORLD.30018.d: "Many South Americans look with concern at Uruguay today as representatives of many Marxist revolutionary groups across the continent meet in Punta del Este. While no public declaration has been made about the specific points or purposes of this gathering yet, political commentators all around raise concerns. Some attendees are highly wanted criminals, and many parties banned in their respective countries are also known to have sent representatives.\n\nWhat also raises concern is the presence of international revolutionary Ernesto Guevara. Following his release from an Argentine prison not so long ago, 'Che' had disappeared from notice, with only hints of a possible exile into Uruguay, and all wonder what his resurfacing might mean."
WORLD.30018.a: "Could they be planning another revolution?"

WORLD.30019.t: "El Cautinazo"
WORLD.30019.d: "The Chilean South is aflame. What began as a simple land seizure by local peasants in the Cautín area has escalated into an effort to seize lands owned by major landlords by force. The nation watches, as everyone expresses support for different factions involved, but some worry as to how this conflict seems to be more coordinated than a simple local struggle.\n\nThe conflict spreads throughout the South like a wildfire. Landlords and peasants alike are arming themselves and building barricades, while radical revolutionary groups fan the flames. Some reports claim that Ernesto Guevara is involved, but those are unconfirmed. As it stands, the Chilean government is quickly losing control of this situation."

WORLD.30020.d: "The dust has settled in Chile, and it appears the Frente Democrático de Chile has secured its near 20 years reign for yet another 6-year term. Hugo Zepeda Barrios was the expected choice for the FDC. A liberal Senator from the North, former president of the Liberal Party, and president of the Senate, his campaign has been a major success.\n\nAs they await the inauguration in November, Zepeda and the FDC have reaffirmed the aim of their government. They seek to continue the political and economic liberalization of the country, and to keep and strengthen its alignment towards the OFN. Zepeda has also raised his voice against political extremism, declaring it has plagued Chile for too long."

WORLD.30021.d: "The dust has settled in Chile, and it appears the Frente Democrático de Chile has secured its near 20 years reign for yet another 6-year term. Julio Philippi Izquierdo is a surprise nominee. A technocratic Economic Minister and staunch supporter of President Alessandri, he managed to consolidate a formidable alliance within the FDC. His name became known due to his excellent handling of the Reconstruction after the Valdivia Earthquake, gathering a following of the then leaderless Radical Party remnants who have become his main political backers.\n\nTo be inaugurated in November, Philippi promises to bring about "sensible change" to Chile by adopting an interventionist attitude towards the economy and social issues, and leaving the door open to "new foreign entanglements in the field of trade and diplomacy""

WORLD.30022.d: "The dust has settled in Chile and it appears the near 20 year reign of the FDC is finally coming to an end, and it would appear that conservatives, albeit in a different form, have made a comeback. At the head of the UNAPO, a populist Coalition, Jorge Prat Echaurren has won the election for the Presidency in a landslide after the FDC, suffering key losses, agreed for a joint right wing ticket.\n\nPrat is a critic of the political establishment, marxist movements, and, resembling populists elsewhere in Latin America, seeks to promote economic growth, increased executive powers, and stop political factionalism, and has some unique proposals such as regional representation and promoting indigenous causes, things which specially hold sway in the South, his main area of support."

WORLD.30023.d: "The dust has settled in Chile, and it appears that the Chilean right has consolidated around Eduardo Frei Montalva, the candidate for the Partido Demócrata Cristiano, or the Christian Democratic Party, in his bid for La Moneda. The PDC promises an odd mixture of a left-tinged economy with a right-tinged society, remaining steadfast in what it considers Christian ethics.\n\nFrei himself is a veteran politician in Chile, having broken from the old Conservative Party in 1938 and founding the Falange Nacional, the precursor to the PDC as it stands today. Being a long-serving senator, he was the Presidential candidate for the PDC in 1958, coming third.\n\nThe long campaign was fraught with tension, with Frei promising unity and togetherness for the nation."

WORLD.30024.d: "The dust has settled in Chile and it appears the near 20 year reign of the FDC has found a radical end as their worse fears come true. A long-time participant in national politics, the Socialist Front has finally managed to secure the Presidency in the form of Dr. Salvador Allende, whose balancing between radicals and moderates has earned him the place as an unifying figure.\n\nDespite this, the FRAP only holds a plurality, already spelling dark clouds in the horizon before Allende is even inaugurated in November. A very mixed reaction has occurred throughout the nation, and polarization can already be felt to be rising. While who Allende will end up listening to in the end remains to be seen, something is clear: It won't be easy, and the way forward for the first democratically elected Marxist in history will be riddled with difficulties of all sorts."

WORLD.30025.d: "As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, João Goulart enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. A grandee of the PTB - a Varguist party - he is an enthusiastic follower of the methods of the influential Getúlio Vargas, and a collaborator of the former president Henrique Teixeira Lott.\n\nFormerly vice-president under the government of Juscelino Kubitschek, he has played an integral role on the PTB's coalition with the centre-left PSD.\n\nHaving now assumed office, Goulart prepares to implement significant reforms in order to build what he believes will be a better, more just society. But rumbles of discontent among conservative and military circles in Brazil mean that he may face far more difficulty in doing this than he and the PTB hoped."

As with the last time around, he ran as the candidate of the centre-left PSD-PTB coalition.\n\nCompared to his previous accession in 1955, when he had to rely on the support of the military to drive back a coup attempt, there has been a complete lack of chaos. Observers consider this a potential indicator of relative stability, unusual given the tumult that usually surrounds the Brazilian democratic process.\n\nKubitschek, not one to rest on his laurels, is already getting to work. Rumour has it that he will be instituting more of the same massive infrastructure and construction programs that were his trademark during the first Kubitschek presidency."

WORLD.30027.d: "As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Jânio Quadros enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. The vice-president in the previous government of President Henrique Lott, he won election as a prominent leader of the conservative UDN.\n\nQuadros, known for his tendency toward flamboyant and erratic behaviour, is a staunch social conservative who plans to promote his concept of "traditionalism" in Brazil. He is also a fanatical opponent of corruption and talks frequently of sweeping Brazil clean of corruption, to the point of being popularly known as the "Broom".\n\nEven more important to him than either of these, however, is his plan to establish an independent Brazilian foreign policy, which international observers believe may complicate the Brazilian-American relationship."

WORLD.30028.d: "As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Carlos Lacerda enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. A strong-willed conservative grandee of the right-wing UDN, he is a fanatical opponent of the ideology and methods of Getúlio Vargas, which he and his cadres pejoratively call "Getulism".\n\nA journalist by trade, he rose to become governor of Guanabara and governed in accordance with free-market conservative principles.\n\nHaving now assumed office, Lacerda prepares to implement significant reforms in order to destroy the Varguist consensus built by the previous PSD-PTB coalition. He is likely to have significant help in this from business interests and the OFN, whom he is known to favor."

WORLD.30029.d: "As the Brazilian elections of 1965 come to an end, Adhemar de Barros enters the Palácio do Planalto in Brasília as the new President of Brazil. Adhemar won office as the leader and linchpin of the populist PSP, which seems to have no policies aside from what he dictates.\n\nIf one were to ask the common Brazilian to describe de Barros, the first thing many of them would come up with is "corrupt". Yet Adhemar is also known for his competence; he leaves behind a trail of deals that benefit those who need it while at the same time lining his pockets and those of his supporters. This is where his nickname, Senhor Rouba-mas-Faz - Mister Steals-but-Delivers - comes from.\n\nMost observers are of the mind that Brazil is in for a "wild ride"; welfare bills are already being drafted and corruption is certain to grow by leaps and bounds during Adhemar's presidency."

WORLD.30030.d: "A concerning development in Brazil as the 1965 presidential election comes to an end, as Carlos Lacerda has seized power, despite the PTB candidate Joao Goulart having been reported as winning the election.\n\nReports from Brazil are unclear, but it seems that Lacerda alleged widespread fraud in the election on part of the PTB. Before these concerns could be addressed, he joined hands with allies to usurp control over the Presidency before Goulart could act. Goulart has fled the country, and Lacerda has now walked into the Palácio do Planalto as the President.\n\nThough Lacerda has seized control of the Presidency through undemocratic means, he has pledged to remain faithful to democratic norms while in office, and to "erase the stain of Varguism from Brazil"."

WORLD.30031.d: "BRASÍLIA - President Quadros is expected to make an announcement later today on television declaring a withdrawal from the South African War. This comes hours after a closed joint session of Congress was held, presumably discussing the terms of withdrawal. The US and the other OFN Nations have declined to make a statement as of yet, but one can only think that this has greatly dropped the morale of the troops on the ground in Africa, who have grown fond of the Brazilian troops. Meanwhile, celebrations and protests are erupting across the country, namely in São Paulo, Quadros' home state. This is a big win for the President's foreign policy, and will definitely give his approval ratings a much needed boost."

Celebrations and protests have broken out across the country, while foreign dignitaries have sent praise in exchanges with their Brazilian counterparts. While some are surprised by this change of events, most people consider it as only being a matter of time before something like this happened.

He is believed to have played a prominent role in the defense during the Guairá Falls Invasion.\n\nHowever, Trujillo seems to have fallen out of favour, following a scandal due to his escapades to benders in Iberia accompanied by the daughters of top Paraguayan officials. This culminated in him and his entourage attempting to escape the wrath of the dictatorship in a limousine, ending in a shootout near the Bolivian border."

Kubitschek's unexpected triumph arrived in the Latin American nation's first lot of elections after its most recent military coup.\n\nAcross Brazil, the newly announced President-elect's supporters have flooded the streets in celebration, with protestors appearing in near equal numbers. The ensuing clashes, in some cases, led to brutal street-fighting, but the popular mood is suffused in Kubitschek's optimism, with many proclaiming the triumph of Brazilian democracy over military influence."

WORLD.30036.d: "Carlos Lacerda, presidential candidate for Brazil's União Democrática Nacional, has won his bid for the Latin American nation's Presidency, overcoming former President Juscelino Kubitschek in a widely anticipated election result. Amid small-scale protests and politically charged street brawls, the former Governor of Guanabara was declared, as the victor of the nation's post-coup elections, President-elect of Brazil.\n\nLacerda's victory comes in the wake of allegations of military favoritism and pro-UDN election meddling. However, these claims have detracted little from the prevailing perception that, with Lacerda in power, Brazilian democracy shall enjoy a new, resurgent age."

Amid the growing number of party dissidents, some veteran adversaries of the President have been quick to blame the loss on his purportedly poor administration of the Latin American nation, as well as his failed efforts to suppress internal Peronist influence - adherents of a populistic ideology endemic to Argentina.\n\nThe loss has exacerbated the mutual enmity of the Unión Cívica Radical's two wings, who now only tentatively share allegiance to their leader. The popular forecast of the Frondizi Presidency oscillates from resignation to military coup. Consensus, both outside and within the government, seems a distant notion.\n\n"

The Colorado clique is known for its extreme anti-Peronism, the political movement of Argentinian strongman Juan Perón, having a rivalry with the moderate Nationalist faction, the Azules. \n\n After defeating the Azules in combat and taking control of Buenos Aires, General Poggi made a speech to the population, informing them about his takeover of the country. Poggi argued the weakness of the deposed government regarding Peronism as his main motive for the coup and that he will eliminate the Fascist menace "by all means necessary".  Complicated times are coming for the country, and violence could escalate at any time."

An unknown figure to the public until a few months ago, Onganía had a meteoric rise through the Argentinian Army, when he defeated the Colorado faction as head of the formerly-constitutionalist Azul clique, and retired after seeing the 1964 elections trough.\n\nAfter taking office, Onganía laid out ambitious plans for a complete economic and political overhaul based on corporatist principles, and expressed a willingness to collaborate with Peronists, who largely supported the coup. While there are great expectations, only time will tell if he succeeds in his endeavours to carry out what he has termed "the Argentine Revolution.""

Arturo Illia of the liberal Unión Cívica Radical has won the presidential election of 1964, successfully preserving democracy. \n\nBut the country doctor from Córdoba inherits control over a nation divided. The economy still suffers terribly. His own party, ostensibly united behind him, is in fact riven by internal divisions. Moreover, the UCR's hegemony has clearly weakened: this can be observed by it having received less than 50% of votes,with the remainder going to Peronist blank-ballots or to the revived conservatives and socialists under Emilio Hardoy and Alfredo Palacios.\n\nBut not all is bad: the military, led now by General Onganía, has expressed its desire to stay away from politics; this gives democratic forces much-needed manoeuvring space."

His own party is internally divided, with a large part of the party displeased with his victory over Illia. Moreover, the UCR's hegemony has weakened; it received less than 50% of votes, with the majority going either to Peronist blank ballots or to the revitalized conservatives and socialists under Emilio Hardoy and Alfredo Palacios.\n\nWith the military under General Juan Carlos Onganía planning to remain away from politics, Frigerio is free to continue the reforms of his predecessor, embracing developmentalism and adopting a technocratic governing style."
