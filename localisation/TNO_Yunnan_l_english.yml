POLITICS_LU_HAN_DESC_1:0 "Lu Han, the lawbringer. Lu Han, the hero of the south. Lu Han, the keeper of national pride. Every day these words, and many others, reverberate through the government centers, schools, businesses, and shops of Yunnan. For they have been taught to worship their liberator, the man who freed the peasants of the landlords.\n\nOf course, he did nothing of the sort. The peasants are still enslaved, the villages are still poor, the national pride is still in shambles, and the country is still ridden with crime. Under Lu, it doesn't look like it will be changing any time soon."

Under Lu, it doesn't look like it will be changing any time soon."
POLITICS_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "Long Yun is a ghost of the past. Once warlord of the Yunnan province, he was betrayed by his cousin, Lu Han, who imprisoned him, subjected him to torture, killed his son, surrendered Yunnan to the Japanese, and kept Long Yun alive out of a twisted sense of guilt and pity.\n\nThese experiences changed Long Yun. How could they not? His mind is broken, or perhaps he is thinking clearly for the first time. He sees China for what it is: A corrupted, ashen land infected by cowardice and shame. But he can also see the new China, struggling to be born out of the old.\n\nLong Yun knows that he will lead China into a black, shining future. Under his leadership, the collaborators will be purged in lakes of sulfur, the Japanese will be cast out of Eden, and the trumpets will summon the horsemen and usher China into a new age.\n\nChina will be free, even if the rest of the world must burn."
POLITICS_NPA_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "The Last Stand has failed. Long Yun, the great liberator of China, is dead. With the Mad King of the Southwest now another annal of China's long and troubled history, the remnants of the National Protection Army stand headless. While some still desperately clinging on to the late general's dream of liberation, others have already surrendered or disappeared into the southwestern mountains, now free from Long's reign."

 YUN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In 1946 Yunnan was one of the few places in China not yet conquered by the Japanese. Seeing the inevitability of Japanese victory and ever more put off by Long Yun's vows to "fight to the last", Lu Han seized the state and pledged the province's allegiance to Japan and their Chinese puppet republic before Yunnan was overrun. In the years since Lu Han has kept his hold on power, however narrow his true support. Han has worked to both bring Guizhou into his "protection" and ensure the stability and development of his home state. Yunnan has come to be known as the protector of the southwest and a profitable area to invest in, so long as you know the right people. However, all this stems from the stability of Lu Han's government, while the winds of change blow where they may..."

yun.1.t:0 "Our Situation"
yun.1.desc:0 "On the southern frontier of what was once China sits a state most people do not know of. A serene little state, picturesque and mountainous, covered in dense forests that buzz with every variety of life you can find this side of paradise.\n\nSee the peasant who tills the fields, who works the mines and carries tremendous weight on their backs for many miles. Lu Han overthrew the foolish nationalistic government in a military coup and has since sought ever closer relations with his two main allies. Within Yunnan are the Yi people, a minority who owns most of the land in Yunnan and of whom Lu Han is their rightful leader. Outside of Yunnan the Yunnan clique answers only to the Imperial throne of Japan. By maintaining this balance between the wealthy privileged elite at home and the wealthy mighty overlords abroad Lu Han ensures his own, and by extension Yunnan's, safety and security.\n\nDespite being what the unkind and foolish may label a "warlord" Lu Han has very little interest in warring. Indeed under his leadership the army has been severely reduced to lower the burden on the budget of the great state of Yunnan, to show the world the peaceful intentions of the splendid realm to the south-west and to ensure no upstart dare do to Lu Han what Lu Han did to gain power in the first place.\n\nOur wealth is in the soil, of that there is no dispute. We extract, we sell. We harvest, we sell. Other's twist the raw material of nature into the wonders of civilization, let us provide the firmament.\n\nBut we must not forget our place. An enemy awaits around every corner, even within our borders the enemy awaits. We must tread carefully but forcefully. On sure feet we march towards a better future.\n\nFor Yunnan. For China. For Lu Han!"
yun.1.a:0 "Onwards!"

yun.2.t:0 "A New Finding of Tin!"
yun.2.desc:0 "An archaeological project being undertaken by all three members of the Kunming Antiquarian Society has been attempting to uncover an ancient village that was burned down during the Taiping rebellion. Early efforts have been promising, already enough sherds to fill a wheelbarrow have been uncovered and the foundations of a large stone house have made them very excited. Far more impressively, an agent of ours has relayed that these three antiquarians have accidentally discovered a very promising vein of tin.\n\nA surveyor dispatched from Kunming has written back explaining that not only have they found a single promising vein, but that the whole local area is dotted with veins and outcroppings which suggest that it is the ideal place to begin a whole complex of mines. Tin is one of our biggest exports already and building up our raw material extraction can only bring good things into this great state. Mineral wealth is the wealth of kings, it is the wealth of the gods and it shall be the wealth of Yunnan.\n\nWe were fully prepared to seize it from it's current owners when we were pleasantly surprised to learn that the site already belongs to the government, we must merely decide what to do with it.\n\nBefore we sign off on this decision we need to address a letter we have received from the Kunming Antiquarian Society begging us to give them just a few more days to remove everything of historical significance from the site."
yun.2.a:0 "Permission Denied."

yun.3.t:0 "The Bidding Begins"
yun.3.desc:0 "News moves slowly in Yunnan. An instruction can be sent to a provincial office and they can spend weeks deliberating their answer before sending it back. It can take months for couriers to carry messages from the sticks to the halls of power. A cousin of the minister for financial affairs insisted she found a village in the south that still thought Yuan Shikai was the emperor. So when twenty communiques are received in one day the office goes into a bit of a panic.\n\nIt seems everyone wants to get their hands on our tin. Tin for bronze. Tin for canned goods. Tin for all the sphere, flowing from Yunnan. We thought we'd make a little bit of money. Well, we're not: We're going to make a tremendous amount of money. Early estimates have already been exceeded.\n\nThe advantage we have right now is that this is a secret auction. None of the interested parties making the bids know how much anyone else is also bidding. This is going to spread like the wildfire we had last year, only we won't have to cover this one up."
yun.3.a:0 "May the highest bid win."

yun.4.t:0 "A Nudge in the Right Direction?"
yun.4.desc:0 "There's a side bet in the office as to who's going to get the contract. The Zaibatsus have the most capital but the least interest. The Reorganized Government wants to build up Chinese industries with Chinese resources, and they may well seek a symbolic victory over our mutual masters. The best odds are on neither of these two, but on the perennial favorite, the locals. A cabal of Yi landowners, keen to maintain their hegemony over Yunnan's land and industry, are scrambling to pool enough resources together to compete with the big boys.\n\nThis auction doesn't need to be left up to chance. We can put a thumb on the scales, after all only we know what the bids are. We could favour our own people, ensuring that the great state of Yunnan will be made ever greater by keeping our hands in our own pockets. We could favor the Republic, drawing Yunnan and China close again once more. Or we could favor the Japanese, opening the door to the ruthless exploitation and advanced mining techniques of the Zaibatsus."
yun.4.a:0 "Let's keep our hands out of this."
yun.4.b:0 "Favour the Reorganized Government."
yun.4.c:0 "Favour Yi landowners."
yun.4.d:0 "Favour the Empire."

yun.5.t:0 "Japan wins the Bid"
yun.5.desc:0 "It would seem that we are some fine alchemists indeed, for we have turned tin into gold.\n\nThe factories of the empire have an endless hunger for our sweet mineral fruit and we are more than content to let them pluck it from out hanging branch. Even as we speak workers and engineers are flocking to Yunnan from across the sphere to start a high tech, modern institution of extraction and exploitation.\n\nNot all is well, however. With great profits comes great suffering. The village we turned out to house the engineers are homeless and destitute. The farmers who are unfortunate to live close to the new mine can only watch as their crops succumb to sickness. The Yi landowners, who see this as the beginning of the end for their hegemony, turn their great wealth against the government. The Reorganized Chinese government and the millions of people in our country who support it protest in the streets. Even the Japanese government is annoyed, seeing us as little more than a sideshow.\n\nStill, just because our neighbors, our superiors, our inferiors and most of our own people are worse off, doesn't necessarily mean that we are. Japan will benefit, we will surely benefit. The auction is over and we had hoped for a little more, but no matter.\n\nThe money we have made from this interaction is the important thing. If we carefully manage this we can bring our countrymen around to the reality of the situation and push Yunnan into the twentieth century with any luck before we reach the twenty first century.\n\nOne can't help but wonder if we might've been better off had our own people or the government of China won the auction, then at least we would've been an important part of a partnership, not just another exploited state. But we can't go back in time, the auction is over."
yun.5.a:0 "To the winner goes the spoils."
yun.5.a.tt:0 "[JAP.GetFlag]§YJapan§! will receive a small source of §GPermanent Income§!, amounting to §Y50M $§! annually."

yun.6.t:0 "Helping the Chinese"
yun.6.desc:0 "Confucius taught us the importance of filial piety. The Reorganized Government in Nanjing is the elder brother to the strong and stable government we enjoy here in Kunming. We owe our brother's all the support we can give, just as we are owed all the support they can give to us in return. For this reason we have decided to keep it in the family and ensure that Chinese tin stays in Chinese hands.\n\nThey may not have the same resources to offer us as do our overlords in Tokyo, but there comes a time when it is not enough to think of money, but to think of countries, of peoples and the long term goals of all the Chinese peoples. We won't ask what our country can do for us, but rather we shall ask what we can do for our country.\n\nThis decision is not merely high minded, it will have useful practical benefits as well. Not only is it always wise to be friendly with your neighbors, but many of our people still stubbornly identify with China as a whole, refusing to recognize the natural splendor of the great state of Yunnan. A compromise is of course possible.\n\nYunnan must take her rightful place not above China, but at the top of the Chinese nation. We are the glistening, glittering mountain jewel of our people. We are the endless treasure chest of our splendid nation. We are the state of Yunnan, but we are the country of China.\n\nIt will be difficult to 'adjust' the auction so that China wins, but we have ways and means."
yun.6.a:0 "China for the Chinese!"
yun.6.a.tt:0 "[CHI.GetFlag]§YChina§! will gain an §Gadvantage§! during the bidding process.\n\n"

yun.7.t:0 "The Rising Sun is not pleased"
yun.7.desc:0 "Kunming burns bright tonight. A fire rages in the hotel where, coincidentally, agents from both Yunnan and China were meeting to ensure the Republic's victory in the auction.\n\nApparently they weren't as inconspicuous as they believed and were trailed by several Kenpeitai operatives who organized the conflagration.\n\nAlthough officially denying responsibility, Tokyo is screaming at us down the other end concerning documents that they "received" from a "whistleblower". They've raised their bid to ensure they win but now we're under close scrutiny. We'll not be allowed to forget this.\n\nAs for the rest of the sphere, we're in a bit of an embarrassment. Even the Reorganized Government, who should theoretically be on our side in all of this, has stopped giving us the time of day. We've implicated them in our own mistake, without asking them if they even wanted the help. We're the black sheep of the sphere."
yun.7.a:0 "Well, we tried."

yun.8.t:0 "Feeding our own Hand"
yun.8.desc:0 "No man becomes rich by giving things away. As it is for men, so it is for states as great as Yunnan.\n\nThe wealthy hands of Nanjing and Tokyo are grasping at our trousers, but our pockets belong to our own hands, thank you very much! The Yi landowners who are such an important part of our society have expressed an interest in our new tin reserve. They have come together in a bit of a cabal to put forward a serious bid on the site. Their efforts are laudable, as well as most certainly patriotic, but they're not exactly up to scratch.\n\nHowever plucky our local landlords may be they just don't have the resources to compete with the great corporations of Japan or the vested interests of the Reorganized Government. Even putting their slaves on the table they can't meet half the biggest offer we've got from abroad.\n\nBut then again, only we know that.\n\nWe're going to ensure that our own investors get the land. They deserve it, they're the hardworking landowners and slave traders who make this country work. It is our noble obligation as their government to protect them and their interests from foreign interference, even if the interference is legal and purely economic.\n\nFurthermore, while both the Reorganized Government and the Japanese would simply pay us a lump sum then extract as much wealth as they can physically get and stash it in their treasuries. This way the wealth we rip from the Earth will circulate inside Yunnan for much, much longer.\n\nWe are nothing if not a state that works, a worker state, and like all workers we simply want to keep as much of our earnings as we can.\n\nFurthermore if we make it purely a domestic venture we can waive all those pesky regulations and high wages and ensure that the local villagers have something to do all day."
yun.8.a:0 "Profit comes first."
yun.8.a.tt:0 "We will give the §Yi Landowners§! of [YUN.GetFlag]§YYunnan§! an §Gadvantage§! during the bidding process.\n\n"

yun.9.t:0 "The Rising Sun Raises the Bid"
yun.9.desc:0 "The stoic mountains of Yunnan are a solid manifestation of serene beauty. An immortal fact of reality that we mortals weave our petty human notions of cities and nations around. Every peak, every valley is a symbol of our pride and our dedication.\n\nYunnan may be made of stone, but our hearts are not. We sincerely wanted to benefit the Yi landowners. We really believed that it was in our economic interest to keep the material wealth of this nation inside this nation, not to carry it over worn out roads to foreign masters thousands of miles away.\n\nFor this lofty goal we were willing to fudge our numbers, to artificially double the bid of the Yi landowners, putting them just in the lead. But then the Japanese raised their bid. Oh my did they raise their bid.\n\nThey didn't double it. They added zeroes. We can't resist that kind of money, we can't match it, even by fiddling the books. We have no choice.\n\nBut on the plus side, we are going to make so much money. A truly ludicrous sum of money.\n\nThe economic benefits of selling out our morals is great, but selling out from selling out pays even better!\n\nIt's vitally important we realise that this of a benefit to Yunnan. It is far more important that the Yi landowners understand that this in their interest too. It isn't but they live in Yunnan, and Yunnan is going to benefit, so really they'll benefit too.\n\nA new age of investment and development awaits us. A new deal, where no peasant will ever be idle, no landowner will ever be poor. Yunnan is great, and it shall be greater still."
yun.9.a:0 "Money is money."

yun.10.t:0 "Concessions to our Overlord"
yun.10.desc:0 "Confucius teaches us the virtue of filial piety. A son owed his father a tremendous debt. So too does the subject owe their master fealty, just as the master owes their subject good governance.\n\nThe hand of our own people reaches towards us, begging for scraps they can't afford. But we can't afford to be charitable. The hand of our countrymen reaches towards us, along with words of comradeship and friendship. But we don't need comrades and we certainly don't need friends. The hand of our overlord reaches down to us from on high, reminding us of our duties and promising a better place in the sphere, to be higher than we are beneath his Imperial majesty.\n\nWe will not bite the hand that feeds us, even if first it steals that food from our own hands.\n\nThere is no shame in brown-nosing to the people who hold all of our lives in their hands. We are a dog, so let us pick a rich family to live in. No family in Asia is as rich as the sphere, and Imperial Japan is the father we must impress to earn a place by his side.\n\nIt is a noble thing to serve, but it is also a profitable thing. We will ensure by our extralegal meddling that Japan attains the tin rights. We will ensure that we have a healthy and profitable relationship with the worlds best superpower. We will ensure that Japan always remembers how loyal we are, how profitable we are an investment and how important our rights and interests are in the wider context of China.\n\nIndependence is for tramps. Codependency is for marriages. Supplication is the path to becoming a great nation in this fractured and dangerous world."
yun.10.a:0 "Only good can come from this."
yun.10.a.tt:0 "[JAP.GetFlag]§YJapan§! will gain an §Gadvantage§! during the bidding process.\n\n"

yun.11.t:0 "The Yi are Not Pleased"
yun.11.desc:0 ""You are a traitor to your nation and to your people."\n\n"Go live in Tokyo Imperial bootlicker!"\n\n"We don't want the likes of you here, this is a local city for local people! There's nothing for YOU here!"\n\nThese are just a selection of some of the lovely messages we have received in angry letters, private communiques and thrown bricks. Apparently word got out that we fiddled the auction. We've been arresting junior members all morning but to no avail, we simply don't know where this leak is.\n\nThe Yi are outraged because they can't see the importance of what we've done. Their tiny minds can't look beyond their own insignificant interests and as a result slaves and peasants all over this country are being forced to stand down their tools. We've sent out the military to make them pick them up again and already we've lost thousands of peasants just this morning!\n\nA certain amount of the money we will receive is going to be set aside to shut these people up.

The Yi are being invited to a calm sit down discussion with the government where all this nastiness can be smoothed over.\n\nWe have shaken the very foundations of Yunnan society.

Despite promises and backroom dealings the money isn't quite what we thought it would be. Installments, deductibles, compensations.

Even He, who won a spectacular personal fortune in the office pool, seems keen to hide any happiness he may feel.\n\nThe general sense both amongst ourselves and the public is that we've completely mismanaged this. We've misstepped and annoyed our neighbors, our people and even ourselves. We never should've meddled.\n\nBut it's all in the past now. Zaibatsu agents fill our bars, spilling out onto the streets. Even while they drink they earn a fortune every hour and the hatred of hundreds every minute.\n\nThe most modern machines operated by the most modern engineers tower over our villagers as they begin the long, slow march out of Japanese land.

From the north and the south two pincers emerged, soaking the road in bullets and eviscerating all but one of the bandits. Tragically we lost half a dozen veterans and the donkey, but we attained the exact victory we sought.\n\nThe bandit we captured has been most useful, after a little Kunming persuasion. Thanks to our exceptional intelligence gathering we've been able to repeat this strike almost a dozen times, up and down the winding roads of Yunnan bandits are cut down, their wretched blood watering the very land they sought to terrorize.\n\nAs we take out these ambushes a pattern emerges, one that draws the eye toward a certain valley, nicknamed 'Serenity' by the locals as a little piece of peasant irony.

Road wardens stop and search every shifty looking merchant and Han peasant they come across.

In one life you'll be overworked and poor, yet in the other you will be briefly overworked and poor until you die. If you're lucky. Covering the cost of these new patrols are the proceeds from selling our captives to Yi landlords so that they can better serve Yunnan by labouring in field and mine.\n\nCrime doesn't pay criminals, but it certainly pays us. With that it in mind the mines are starting to run empty. It seems that would be robbers don't want to risk slowly working themselves to death. Either that or all the criminals are already dead or captured. Either way the evidence is clear, deterrence just works.\n\nIt may have cost thousands of lives, but the sun sits high over Yunnan today. Honest and hardworking are her people.

The sound of gunshots and yells filled the air, exciting the recaptured criminals within the prison who rattled their bars and hollered encouragement for their escaped comrade.\n\nThe pursuing soldier, realizing he would be unable to catch the remarkably athletic prisoner, stopped, kneeled, aimed his rifle, and fired once - The bullet whizzed past the target.\n\nTwice - The bullet grazed the prisoner's leg, turning the white cotton red.\n\nThrice - The bullet flew true and ripped through the back of the prisoner's neck.\n\nThe prisoner collapsed forward and slammed into the ground. Blood gushed from his neck in thick spurts, pooling around his head. His killer ran over to him and turned his body over to identify his victim.\n\nThe soldier stared down.\n\nLong Yun stared back.\n\nHe looked beyond the young soldier and gazed at the sky.\n\nHis last thoughts were of the beautiful blue emptiness covering China."

"That I will not take up arms against Long Yun."\n\nThe soldiers around them looked up at the footman. One by one, they broke ranks and gathered around him, in opposition to the sergeant.\n\nThe name "Long Yun" spread through the men like an infectious virus. Soon, Hu Ruoyu's small army had divided in two factions: the growing Yun defectors and the shrinking loyalists.\n\nHu Ruoyu could not believe his eyes. His own men - Traitors!

All of the men, regardless of their side in the preceding dispute, looked at him with fear. He slowly examined his audience, his eyes passing over everyone, including Hu Ruoyu, with apparent disinterest.\n\nNo one spoke.\n\n"Have we let ourselves fall so low?"

"Do we!?"\n\nHe pointed at Hu Ruoyu's second-in-command and lowered his voice.\n\n"Do we?"\n\nThe second-in-command gazed at the bone-white finger thrust towards him, and then at the man connected to it. And then he looked beyond the man, to the rage that burned within his soul. He saw death, destruction, and terrible acts. He saw a pale horse, a broken seal, and the end of the world. He saw the future laid before him, a single road paved with bones and washed in blood.\n\n"No, General Long Yun." He answered.

He felt his previous anxiety melt away.\n\nEverything was okay.

He saw the pieces move back and forth as the battle progressed. He saw the red advance and the blue topple over. It was a swirling purple whirlwind that slowly, but inexorably, squeezed closer and closer to the center of the map, to his bunker, until it was a neat pattern of upright red and horizontal blue.\n\n"I don't know." he sighed. "Maybe I thought that everything here," he said, gesturing beyond the bunker, to the province of Xinan. "Was worth protecting. It doesn't really matter if it is now." He laughed, though there was no humor in it. "Our fate is sealed."\n\nYe Jianying nodded in understanding.

With that, the general left his house, and with it, his guilt. The only instinct now was self preservation. The drive from Nanning to Qinzhou was long, and if he hoped to survive, he would need to pass the checkpoint at the bridge.\n\nPulling up to the checkpoint, General Xia trembled.

"Are to liberate China."\n\nWith his final effort expended, Long Yun collapsed into the bed, his scarred, wrinkled arms hanging limply by his side.\n\nMost of the officers began to yell, ordering the doctors to do the impossible.

The sticks were well used last night, as the import and home goods warehouse on the corner of Lu Han st. and Five Mountain ave. went up in a column of spitting fire. The fire spread only to the two nearest warehouses before the fire department martialled the workers to bring the other warehouses crashing down. The speed at which this strategic demolition was carried out is a triumph of deregulation. In addition to imports and home goods, a warehouse full of 'genuine' Japanese rice-wine and another full of coal for domestic use continue to burn until now, and show no signs of abating.\n\nThe fire was likely started by an enemy of the state, eager to spread discord and chaos amongst our fine city. The current top suspect is one Zhang Wei, a recently hired worker who previously had been a free peasant in a northern village. Anger at the mining company that threw him from his ancestral land, as well as his descent from comfortable frugality to abject poverty, fostered a sickening anti-authoritarian sentiment in the young man. Under interrogation, the terrorists friends revealed that he also harboured rage at the system itself, being reduced to handling luxury goods that on his wages he could never hope to afford.\n\nAs a precaution we've arrested every member of his village in Kunming, as well as a number of other suspects. All in all, the fire has cost the city tens of thousands of Yuan and a couple dozen workers. The recently imprisoned suspects have been rushed to the scene to help with clean up and repairs.

The sheer number of slaves is overwhelming, accompanied by their surprising level of organization has us on the back foot. Frankly, we are starved for options."\n\n"Put them down. There is no other option." butted in the foreign minister.\n\n"It isn't that easy. We can't take on all of them, believe me I would if I could." "Then what do you propose?" "Well, I suppose we could offer them something? Attempt to quell their hatred so this doesn't happen again?"\n\n"Or we can remove this decrypted system all together?" came a stern voice from the back of the room, prompting much debate. "Stop all of you! You are giving me a headache, my decision is clear..."

YUN_in_the_west_desc:0 "Without the aid of the capital and below the notice of the Japanese, the people of the Southwest must fend for themselves. In the mountains and fields we have only ourselves to turn to for justice, order and progress, and it is Lu Han to whom we turn."
YUN_everything_for_my_friends:0 "Everything For My Friends"
YUN_everything_for_my_friends_desc:0 "It is only natural that those who would play such a prominent role in both the stability and advancement of Yunnan would be rewarded in turn. Lu Han would not even think of his good friends and allies having anything less than the first pick of the province. After all, they earned it."
YUN_the_law_for_my_enemies:0 "The Law For My Enemies"
YUN_the_law_for_my_enemies_desc:0 "Slander and lies have no place in Yunnan, at least not when they are in opposition to the government. The law is quite clear about what happens to those found guilty of... whatever the courts find them guilty of. And the courts know their duty well."
YUN_minerals_for_those_who_can_pay:0 "Minerals For Those Who Can Pay"
YUN_minerals_for_those_who_can_pay_desc:0 "Yunnan has been blessed with an abundance of resources lying within the ground, and cursed with a drought of cash with which to access it. A newly discovered deposit may send investors scurrying to Lu Han to gain his favor and slander their opponents, but in the end Lu Han must accept payment from where the capital flows, so long as it does flow."
YUN_one_more_bandit_hunt:0 "One More Bandit Hunt"
YUN_one_more_bandit_hunt_desc:0 "The bandits and communists which once roamed the land with impunity have largely been put in their place, either dead or having fled to Xikang in hopes of "employment". But there is one last thorn in the side of Yunnan, one group which insists on raiding from their mountain hideout. A hideout which has just been found. The call from Lu Han was immediate: Every unit would march to the mountains, including those in Guizhou! One more victory for the army, united under Lu Han!"
YUN_crush_the_rats:0 "Crush The Rats!"
YUN_crush_the_rats_desc:0 "With this victory the last challenge to Lu's authority will be crushed. With this victory the army will be truly united.

YUN_the_two_brothers:0 "The Two Brothers"
YUN_the_two_brothers_desc:0 "Like brothers Yunnan and Guizhou have stood together against anarchy, against secession, and like brothers they have come to love each other and cooperate in everything.

YUN_winning_friends_desc:0 "Lu Han has many friends, and he knows just how to keep them: money. It seems that in his recent relaxation He Yingqin has been forgetful of his old friends, a mistake that Lu promises will not be repeated under his supervision.

YUN_closed_to_yi_exploitation_desc:0 "The people of Guizhou are sadly less enthusiastic about the incoming unification than we are, with rumours abounding about plans to enslave and exploit the people, and bloody crackdowns on disent.

YUN_united_economy:0 "United Economy"
YUN_united_economy_desc:0 "No split may divide the south west, no artificial barriers may stop unification. While keeping the economies unintegrated may let a few fat cats keep their riches it will also permanently divide the new province. What is the point of going to all this trouble if nothing of substance changes? Not to mention, the unification has gotten up the hopes of many of our own Yi entrepreneurs who would be very disappointed should the unification be only in name."
YUN_uniform_legal_code:0 "Uniform Legal Code"
YUN_uniform_legal_code_desc:0 "Break one law? Just hope over the border and you are scot free! Chaos in trade, in the media, in everyday life is the only reward for being so lazy as to unify without actually unifying! The laws of Yunnan were approved by Lu Han himself, and were virtually identical to Guizhou's until recent years. We would be doing a disservice by accepting anything less than total uniformity."
YUN_he_must_retire:0 "He Must Retire"
YUN_he_must_retire_desc:0 "No one doubts He Yingqin's record in the past and we have much to thank him for. But in recent years he has become reserved, retrieting into his palace and delegating ever more authority to those unworthy of it. Not to mention, should He remain in power all those who would resist this merging of provinces will rally to him, whether he desires it or not. An honorable retirement is in order, but He must go."

The start of this new era has been accompanied by parades, bands, grand dinners and all the other melodrama of state. Let the people rejoice!"
YUN_a_promise:0 "A Promise"
YUN_a_promise_desc:0 "With the announcement over and the deadline drawing near it is only expected that those patriots who bravely aided the creation of Xīnán be rewarded in turn. And they all intend to ensure Lu Han is aware of that fact. Land, gold, currency, positions in the administration and protection from the free market has all been promised. And what kind of man would Lu be if he were not true to his word?"
YUN_united_at_last:0 "United At Last"
YUN_united_at_last_desc:0 "The final disruptions are over, the names have been changed and the world notified. All that is left now is for Lu Han himself to make the trip and officially declare the work of government to begin.

YUN_on_solid_ground_desc:0 "At long last our hopes have become reality. Yunnan and Guizhou are both under the rule of Lu Han, and the Yunnan clique has come to protect another province. While we faced unrest and protest from some the result was never truly in doubt: one state, one army, one leader. As the maps are redrawn and streets renamed we are finally in a position to advance with order and progress unimpeded."

YUN_biased_land_distribution:0 "Biased Land Distribution"
YUN_biased_land_distribution_desc:0 "He Yingqin himself held not inconsiderable land, and the same can be said of many of his old allies. Their lands now lay open, with their laborers anxious to learn what will become of them. Naturally those close to Lu Han as well as those who have been so instrumental in the creation of Xīnán ought to be given first pick of the unowned land, and a simple vetted auction will quite easily take... some of this land off of Lu's hands. Some shall be acquired by Lu Han himself, naturally."
YUN_two_brothers_still:0 "Two Brothers Still"
YUN_two_brothers_still_desc:0 "While the names have been changed and the borders have been redrawn, the simple fact remains that Yunnan and Guizhou are not the same land and cannot be treated as such. Under the watchful eye of Lu Han only the highest level of administration shall be fully changed, and local life may go on much as it has before the merging of the two. The boss's boss may change and the taxes are paid to a different man, but it is best not to offend unnecessarily."
YUN_rational_infrastructure:0 "Rational Infrastructure"
YUN_rational_infrastructure_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest enemy of wealth in Xīnán is its poor infrastructure. Winding through mountains the roads often lead to nowhere, or to towns long since declined after the war.

YUN_playing_to_our_strengths_desc:0 "The great state of Xinan has been undervalued by the establishment in Nanjing and Tokyo. Our fields and forests grow thick with produce. Our mines are deep and well-dug. Our peasants work as hard and for as little pay as any peasant in the whole Sphere.\n\nBut there is room here for improvement. Our fields are great but still too small, too ancient in their design. Our mines could be dug so much deeper, so much more greedily, and our peasants often have enough time in the day to partake in indolence, and they would not suffer much to be a little hungrier.\n\nWe understand that this is not the conventional wisdom. The Re-organized Government seeks to move beyond being a 'mere' breadbasket, This suits us in two ways. First of all the demand for raw materials grows ever stronger as new factories flicker into life, and second of all the stomach of the sphere will grow no less hungry as the cities rise and sprawl from the dirt like the wild mushrooms we export in great, yet inadequate quantities.\n\nWe will seize the mantle as the true 'breadbasket' of the sphere, and Xinan will provide the raw firmament they shall twist into the miracles of a new age."

This isn't an issue on its own, but it reveals a shocking lack of progress in this, the cornerstone of our economy. Our landscape is draped in mountains and plateaus, the buried bounty of the Earth lies just beyond our grasp. But not for long. We must bring our eyes to bare upon these resources, opening bold new avenues of tin, lead, zinc, iron, silver, gold and coal, as well as a hundred other roads that we shall take to prosperity.\n\nFor this task the few experts we have to hand will be rallied, along with a few experts in geology, geography, metallurgy and the mining industry from as far away as Manchuria. The likely candidates first, near existing mines. After these have been examined we shall move on to new pastures that we shall rip up and exploit. Once we have the facilities in place, all gathered under a new 'Bureau of expansion, efficiency and exploitation', we shall methodically and thoroughly examine the country for likely sites. The land must be numbered, weighed for it's potential and divided into new zones for development.\n\nSome of these developments will be resisted by reactionary elements who fear progress. They will protest that we would destroy their villages, their forests and their fields. But the march of time is inexorable, We have not yet begun the survey, but the writing is on the wall."

If local stocks are inadequate, we have agents in our neighbours seeking emergency ribbon suppliers.

Now the fire spreads and rises and roars through forest and valley and mountain. Xinan shall burn with Long Yun's righteous fire. China shall burn. The sphere shall burn. All shall burn.\n\nXinan was never a great state. It was idle and weak, lazy and degenerate. It bowed before Japan, debasing itself rather than die with dignity. It offered up its riches, the very lifeblood of it's earth, to grasping Zaibatus and Keiretsu, rather than use that wealth to spray the guts of the salaryman to the four winds. It sided with the so-called 'Reorganised Government' of traitors and bootlicking Hanjian scum, rather than to kill the false Chinese and keep China pure! But most wretchedly of all it did not even have the strength to kill Long Yun when it had the chance and by hell or high-water no-one shall ever have that chance again! Until the dying breath of the last true Chinese we will fight, we will kill, we will win. There is no alternative.

From this day forward our slavish obsession with exports ends. The factories of Nanjing and Tokyo shall grow cold in their idleness, fitting mausoleums for dreams that should have long since died. The factories of Kunming shall spin, and roar, and scream out their fury at a Heaven and Earth which turned its back on them. Pillars of smoke shall hold up the sky. Mountains of ash shall keep down the Earth. We shall become the mill which rips the chaff from the wheat of China. Xinan was a land of sweat, slaves and slavers.

Perhaps they owe the servant a wage, money for his life, measured in minutes and hours. That is the spirit of the American. Perhaps they owe the servant 'a place in something greater', whatever that means. That is the spirit of the Japanese. We do not need to ask ourselves this question, Confucius has long since answered it for us. A servant deserves the guidance and the compassion of the master. Between the two of them there must be an unshakeable bond of loyalty. China has been disloyal to the Chinese in her subservience just as the Chinese were disloyal to China by their weakness.

All things considered we showed considerable restraint in our liberation of China from Hanjian rule, and our soldiers come from the poorest and most destitute backgrounds in all the sphere.

China, as a whole, undivided and united behind a strong leader, didn't lose. It has never lost. China needs to be truly one country, not a group of nations or a federation or a nation with regional autonomies, but a singular, solid unitary nation.
