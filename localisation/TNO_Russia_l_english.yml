Before long, however, fascism coalesced within the city. Under the leadership of Rodzaevsky and Matkovsky, the Russian Fascist Party (RFP) soon became the premier party of the Russian émigrés. As the Union collapsed, the Whites and the RFP formed a united front against the Bolsheviks and for a time, they were successful - until infighting split them apart.

 POLITICS_NO_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, no successor or splinter states have emerged in the most isolated peripheries of Siberia. Without any centralized bureaucracy, infrastructure, industry, large-scale trade, or long-distance communication to unite the region, the villages have largely reverted to the lifestyle they have held for centuries: subsistence farming, hunting, and animal herding. The local Yakut, Eveny, and Chukchi peoples have returned to practicing their shamanistic beliefs free of interference, and the Orthodox Russian villages do not bother to trouble them. The furthest anyone usually goes is over to the next village over, and residents may go many years before hearing a single scrap of news from the outside world.\n\nWhile the region may be rich in resources, the warlords in more habitable climes to the south and west see no point in conquering them. The size of the region, the lack of roads, and the harshness of the winters are enough to deter any sensible despot from attempting such a foolish action. And there is little danger in simply ignoring them - the closest most of the villages have to an army is a few old men armed with even older hunting rifles. It seems that unless the people of Siberia are able to somehow unify themselves or are conquered by a successful claimant to Russia's legacy, they will continue to eke out an existence as they always have: isolated and alone, on the edge of the world."

Tracing it's history back to 1807, when it was first founded by the orders of Emperor Alexander I, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant had become the main firearm manufacturer for the Red Army during the war years, producing millions and millions of rifles of every kind. The enterprise was reorganized and reconstructed by prosperous gunsmith Mikhail Kalashnikov for the West Russian Revolutionary Front during its revanché against Germany, but the advance of the Tsarist cohort under Emperor Vladimir III forced the factory personnel to flee to Siberia, leaving the mechanical plant at the disposal of the Imperial Crown.\n\nDespite the damage it endured through the years of constant conflicts of West Russia, the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant remains one of the biggest arms manufacturing facilities in the Russian lands and provides superiority in firearms to any petty king in Russia who owns it."

### Events ###
 #Raiding
 raiding.100.t:0 "An Ultimatum"
 raiding.100.d:0 "We have received an ultimatum from [FROM.GetName], they are demanding that we hand over a tribute of loot, or else they will raid us and take it from us anyways.\n\nWe are at an impasse to decide, do we decide to engage in confrontation with [FROM.GetName], possibly risking our men dying at the hands of our enemies, or do we instead stand down and cave in to their demands, giving them the desired loot, allowing our men to live to fight another day?"
 raiding.100.a:0 "We will not back down so easily!"
 raiding.100.b:0 "Perhaps it is best we stand down and pay them the desired tribute."

 raiding.101.t:0 "They Refuse Tribute"
 raiding.101.d:0 "As is expected, [FROM.GetName] has told us that they reject our offer and are ready for battle, we must ready our men to prepare for the fight.\n\nAlas, bloodshed is sometimes unavoidable and we must prepare for what is to come, if they aren't going to cooperate, it is time we take the loot from [FROM.GetName] by force."
 raiding.101.a:0 "The sounds of gunfire continue to resonate in Russia..."
 raiding.101.a.tt:0 "...only to be canceled by a sudden change."

 raiding.102.t:0 "Tribute Paid"
 raiding.102.d:0 "Miraculously, [FROM.GetName] has caved in and paid us tribute, handing over our desired loot from their state. Bloodshed has been avoided and our men live to fight another day, it is unlikely that [FROM.GetName] is to surrender to us so easily again."
 raiding.102.a:0 "Threats are sometimes needed to survive in the anarchy of Russia."

 raiding.1.t:0 "Raid Successful"
 raiding.1.d:0 "Our reports have returned; our men hurry home with trucks filled with loot and blood smeared over their hands. They congratulate each other for the successful raid against the unsuspecting enemy, patting their comrades on the back and taking the last few shots at the survivors scurrying away. We proclaim victory in this skirmish, as our men cheer and whistle in the hysteria of war, eager to present to us the treasures they have prized from the grips of our adversaries."
 raiding.1.a:0 "Seize all that we can use."
 
 raiding.2.t:0 "Raid Canceled"
 raiding.2.d:0 "We have no choice but to cancel the raid. Our raiding party rabble and rave, unable to communicate and work as a unit. They constantly jam their guns, and feud over scraps of ammunition they steal from each other. To send these clueless regulars out would be ridiculous - suicidal, even. Our time is best spent arming and training these men with the few resources we can gather so our next raid will not end in a total disgrace."
 raiding.2.a:0 "We were just not prepared..."
 
 raiding.3.t:0 "The Raid Fails"
 raiding.3.d:0 "Our men rush back from the frontier, wounded and bloody. Some dash with bandages wrapped around their battered heads; others lay motionless on the back of moving vehicles groaning and beckoning for help. The raid against our neighbors was an ambush, and they repelled our men with deadly force. Some of our dead are wagoned back with gashed flesh, exploded skulls, or chewed up by machine gun fire. We need more time to recover and recuperate, and perhaps with enough resources we can strike again."
 raiding.3.a:0 "We'll get the bastards next time!"
 
 raiding.4.t:0 "We have been raided!"
 raiding.4.d:0 "Our reports have come back from the frontiers, and it's terrible news. Bandits have ambushed our garrisons and massacred our men, leaving them as grotesque and gnarled corpses scattered across the plains. Moreover, we have been informed that they have infiltrated border towns and villages, plundering and looting all they could from the defenseless population. With our units unprepared, there is little we can do as they scurry back to where they came from, having left a path of utter misery and rampage behind them."
 raiding.4.a:0 "Dear God!"
 
 raiding.5.t:0 "The Enemy Falters"
 raiding.5.d:0 "With our recent preparation of defense procedures across the frontiers, the bandits from across the border scurry back into the shadows. No longer do they froth at the mouth and hunger for our bounties as they fear our potential for violent conflict over these contested territories. Clearly, expert defense and mind games have won the battle before a single drop of blood needed to be shed, as the enemy cowers before the skill and might of [Root.GetName]."
 raiding.5.a:0 "Hah! Look at the cowards run!"
 
 raiding.6.t:0 "The Enemy is Defeated"
 raiding.6.d:0 "Recent reports have been sent in of an overwhelming victory against a recent party of raiding bandits. In a brutal standoff, they were decimated by our valiant defense forces, and now their bodies lie scattered and mutilated by war. With survivors dashing for cover and retreating into the misty frontiers, our soldiers chant songs of victory and heroism in the face of invading evil. The rush of bloody defeat will certainly teach them a lesson about attacking the lands of [Root.GetName] for years to come!"
 raiding.6.a:0 "Now on to cleaning up the corpses..."
 
 raiding.7.t:0 "Relics of the Past"
 raiding.7.d:0 "Our recent raid on enemy territory has been a resounding success. After subduing the enemy forces on the battlefield, our brave soldiers have marched into several of the border towns and scrounged up treasures from the days of when Russia was united. Serving as a painful reminder of our own pitiful divisions, we have determined that some of these items can prove useful in developing our own fledgling industry. Indeed, we hope that they can aid in our return to the same position of power these commodities were fashioned in, and elevate these lands to a respectable and peaceful way of living once again."
 raiding.7.a:0 "But we must also think of the future..."
 
 raiding.8.t:0 "Food for the Hungry"
 raiding.8.d:0 "At long last, everyone finally has food for the night, and we need no longer work on empty bellies and broken hearts. Living off of half rations for months had taught us all temperance and composure, but gnawed at our minds in a silent and icy hysteria. Now, we have plenty of food for generations to come, and the people of [Root.GetName] can begin their toils without hunger bothering them throughout their maddeningly tiresome days."
 raiding.8.a:0 "Guess we're not going hungry tonight..."
 
 raiding.9.t:0 "The Spoils of War"
 raiding.9.d:0 "Victory! Our raiding parties drag home great bounties tied down to the roofs of military vehicles and lumped in sacks carried on horseback from enemy territories. With these treasures, we are able to fill our coffers, restock our armories, and increase production in our local industries. The balance of power has clearly shifted in our favor, and with each skirmish to come, we are better armed to tackle these challenges that encroach across the wild Russian frontiers."
 raiding.9.a:0 "This will help in the future."
 
 raiding.10.t:0 "Treasure!"
 raiding.10.d:0 "Our men have crushed the enemy, and uprooted from the land of everything of use to our raiding parties. In the chaos and hysteria of the violence, some of our men had smashed through the locks of a warehouse and stumbled across great treasures beyond our wildest dreams! Scrounging up the gold, precious metals, statues, and other remnants of Russia's past, dragging these relics home brings us immense wealth, prestige, and nostalgia for a great time. Perhaps this, even in the violence and brutality of these skirmishes, is a sign of great times to come for our people."
 raiding.10.a:0 "A Relic of the Past..."
 
 raiding.11.t:0 "Machines of the Past"
 raiding.11.d:0 "After crushing our foe, our men had charged into the enemy's warehouses and armories, snatching everything of use and destroying the rest that could not be carried. A group of our soldiers stumbled into a storage facility housing great industrial equipment. It would only be fitting to strap the machines to the back of our vehicles and haul them to our factories, where they can be appropriated and integrated into our production lines. Perhaps one day, with one machine at a time, we can rebuild Russia from the ground and restore her to her former glory."
 raiding.11.a:0 "With these maybe Russia will be rebuilt one day..."
 
 raiding.12.t:0 "Memories of the Past"
 raiding.12.d:0 "Our men rushed into the then desolate military bases of the enemy, surrounded by the bodies of the dead. Bursting through doors, yelling and wailing in a warlike-hysteria, and opening indiscriminate fire on any stragglers, our men flew down tight corridors and bombed-out rooms. They tore apart cabinets and storage units in search for supplies, arms, and equipment, until one detachment darted into a warehouse facility only to find relics of an old Russia. They put down their arms, and began scrounging to gather all the photos, video reels, and items they could. Receiving the goods this morning, we have found immense riches in the films, books, and paintings of a Russia before the anarchy - a beckoning reminder of our past glories and current shame."
 raiding.12.a:0 "With these maybe Russia will be united once more..."
 
 raiding.13.t:0 "Food Stolen"
 raiding.13.d:0 "This morning, we have found our food supplies emptied and looted by runaway bandits and criminals. At at least three locations, warehouses stockpiling grain, meats, salts, and tinned foods had been plundered, leaving nothing but a few spilled sacks of barley and ruined tins of meat. Children go to bed hungry at night, and farmers struggle to support our population. Something must be done, as it is only a number of weeks until our people will turn weapons on each other for something to eat."
 raiding.13.a:0 "Half-Rations this month it seems"
 
 raiding.14.t:0 "Garrison Slaughtered"
 raiding.14.d:0 "We awake today to news of death and defeat. Our barracks have been ravaged by bandit pillagers, and our garrison forces lay dead on the dirt in a particularly gruesome and horrific manner. With blood and brains splattered across walls and a glowing smoke leaving the soldier's quarters, our manpower has been seriously diminished by raiding forces in acts of sheer wickedness and brutality. Now, they are nowhere to be seen; the winds of the frontiers whistle and beckon, and the people of [Root.GetName] cower with fear. Whatever action is to be taken against these barbarian armies, it must be swift and it must be soon."
 raiding.14.a:0 "Bury the dead, and inform the families..."
 
 raiding.15.t:0 "Damaged Machinery"
 raiding.15.d:0 "After the latest raid in our territories, we can thankfully report that most of our civilian population has remained unharmed. However, the same cannot be said for our industrial production. With factory equipment plundered and multiple mills razed to the ground, our progress towards industrial development has been hampered significantly. Whilst we cannot improve our production as effectively at the moment, we can safeguard our people. Indeed, whilst machinery can be lost and retrieved - lives cannot."
 raiding.15.a:0 "Bastards!"
 
 raiding.16.t:0 "Looted Armouries"
 raiding.16.d:0 "Our generals have reported to us that a handful of armories under our control have been looted by raiding bandits. Rifles and ammunition have been reported missing; some armories having all of their contents emptied and stolen by raiding parties disappearing overnight. Assuming that these raiders have now long scurried past the frontiers by now, we find with our warehouses barren, we have less and less arms to defend ourselves from their prying hands. Action must be taken, lest we are soon robbed of our lives."
 raiding.16.a:0 "This will only encourage them..."
 
 raiding.17.t:0 "Villages Destroyed"
 raiding.17.d:0 "We have received reports today from the smouldering villages on our borders with neighboring territories. Our people have been slaughtered and our industries have been destroyed; raiding bandits must've crossed the frontiers with enough might and savagery to decimate our defences and leave our people bludgeoned and beaten. Hundreds lay dead on the ground in homes, town halls, and workplaces, and survivors shudder when talking of the raids. Stripped of much of our ability to effectively defend against bandit onslaught, we have been dealt a striking blow to our ability to govern these disputed territories. This is one of our weakest moments, and we must do all we can to survive and recuperate before we inevitably strike back with a burning fury."
 raiding.17.a:0 "What kinds of animals would do this..."

 #West Russian Wonders
 RUSwonder.0.t:0 "An End to Wonders"
 RUSwonder.0.desc:0 "We have come far! Where once our government was seen as a mere warlord, holding onto a scrap of Russian land, we can now assert ourselves as a proper nation on the world stage. Having made it into the final basket of candidates to reunify Russia, our country can stand proud of its accomplishment, and look to the road ahead with determination.\n\nThis progress has filled our citizens with awe, even as we rebuild the country, its infrastructures and its industries. However, our successes have rendered the Wonders of old much less critical to our efforts. Where once holding on to these relics of a happier past gave our government legitimacy and gave our people tools needed for survival, the Wonders under our control are now a tiny portion of our overall assets. They will no doubt continue to inspire our people, and they stand as mementos to the warlord era; but the age where holding onto Wonders was of great importance has come to an end."
 RUSwonder.0.a:0 "Onto an uncertain future."

 RUSwonder.1.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Captured!"
 RUSwonder.1.desc:0 "We have acquired the Gorky tank factory, the largest producer of armored vehicles in West Russia.\n\nThis factory was a vital part of Soviet industrial production and saw heavy usage during the West Russian War. In the aftermath of the WRRF's collapse, it fell into the hands of Nikolai Averin and his divisions of bandits, who used the factory to pump out tanks for their raids on Reichskommissariat Moskowien. An ignoble fate, for such an important piece of military infrastructure!\n\nTanks are rare among the warlords of Russia, making anyone who can produce them a force to reckon with and making the factory a highly sought after prize. Now that it belongs to us, we can utilize Gorky's tank factory for a higher purpose than stealing scraps from the Germans.\n\nRegaining the capacity to produce tanks will be another step towards achieving the military capabilities of a full-fledged nation, and another step towards declaring a final victory in West Russia."
 RUSwonder.1.a:0 "The power of modern warfare, unleashed."

 RUSwonder.2.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Captured!"
 RUSwonder.2.desc:0 "We have secured the arsenal in Syktyvkar, a major stockpile of military weaponry that could prove decisive in securing victory in West Russia. Previously in the hands of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, it came into the possession of the fledgeling Komi Republic when the WRRF fled Syktyvkar. Komi used the arsenal to maintain order inside of its notoriously unstable capital and establish itself as a regional power, but, even with full access to it, was unable to prevent its loss. The arsenal contains firearms, explosives, tanks, and chemical weaponry, a fearsome collection for any would-be conqueror.\n\nHaving taken it, we are at a hefty advantage, proudly wielding the weapons that will bring us victory in West Russia. In the perpetual resource shortage of the post-Soviet order, every gun counts. Our control over the arsenal will afford us all the equipment we need to impose our authority over the region."
 RUSwonder.2.a:0 "Locked and loaded."

 RUSwonder.3.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.3.desc:0 "After conquering the city of Izhevsk, we have secured our control over the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, the single greatest center of arms production in West Russia. Izhevsk has long been used to pump out enormous quantities of pistols, rifles, and other small arms. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Izhevsk and its factory became the property of Vladimir Romanov, the purported successor to Russia's late Tsar, who used it to build up his reactionary forces in a play for regional domination.\n\nNow that the plant is solidly ours, we can use it for the same purpose. In the Great Patriotic War and West Russian War, it was one of the primary producers of weapons for a huge number of soldiers. We can ensure that our armies are armed with new, modern firearms while our opponents struggle to assemble outdated arsenals."
 RUSwonder.3.a:0 "Drown them in a wave of lead."

 RUSwonder.4.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Lost!"
 RUSwonder.4.desc:0 "We fought long and hard, but we have lost control of the Gorky tank factory, a major blow to our vehicle production capacity. The tank factory, formerly used to great effect by the West Russian Revolutionary Front against the Germans, has long been a strategic lynchpin in the region, since it is one of the only industrial centers capable of creating heavy armor. Tanks are disproportionately powerful against the relatively lightly armed armies that make up most of West Russia's military forces; any warlord with them in possession can expect to be taken very seriously.\n\nThe factory gave us an undeniable edge in firepower, and will likely be used for very similar purposes by its new owners. We are far from doomed, but we should expect a larger quantity of tanks and armored vehicles in the near future and prepare accordingly."
 RUSwonder.4.a:0 "A troubling development."

 RUSwonder.5.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Lost!"
 RUSwonder.5.desc:0 "Our soldiers defended it in running street battles throughout Syktyvkar, but the massive arsenal stored in that city is no longer ours. Belonging initially to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the arsenal was abandoned when the Red Army fled the city in the late 1950's and used by the Komi Republic to maintain order and equip its military. It includes a great quantity of firearms, ammunition, grenades, and, perhaps most interestingly to the less discerning warlord, chemical weapons.\n\nWe have much to fear now that the arsenal has left our control. We have naturally acted according to the laws of warfare, but that same guarantee cannot be said of our opponents; it is entirely possible that the arsenal's new stewards will employ chemical weapons against us. This, combined with the new deficit in weapon quantity caused by the turnover, means that the balance of power in West Russia has shifted by a noticeable amount."
 RUSwonder.5.a:0 "We are outgunned, but not yet outmatched."

 RUSwonder.6.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.6.desc:0 "With the loss of the city of Izhevsk, and the mighty Izhevsk Mechanical Plant with it, we may be in dire straits. The plant, the largest small arms factory in West Russia, is a prize coveted by any warlord worth his salt. Its usage dates back to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the only force in living memory able to produce weapons on a quantity capable of challenging Germany. The plant went from their control to ours, and now lies in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNothing is certain in the chaotic battlefields of West Russia, but we can surmise that this has been a significant loss to our forces. Although we will not feel the loss immediately, the decrease in our productive capacity is sure to have negative effects on our ability to equip our troops in the future. Shortages are likely, and modern production techniques will once again become a luxury for our forces. We are far from finished, but this is a concerning development nevertheless."
 RUSwonder.6.a:0 "We will make up for their guns with our mettle."
 
 RUSwonder.7.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Caputured!"
 RUSwonder.7.desc:0 "As our men sweep over the arctic plains, the infamously dreadful Vorkuta Gulags have come under our administration. The dark complex of watch-towers, gloomy barracks, and labor camps strike a trembling fear in these icy wastes; the unbelievable torture of this natural prison serves as a reminder of the wickedness of men. The enemy's men lay scattered across the courtyard, buried in debris and torn to pieces by machine gun fire. With blood freshly painted on dark brick walls, the smell of gunpowder was thick and the silence after battle was deafening.\n\nWe were in a place of immense suffering, and whilst many of our men broke down doors to scurry in and rummage for loot, others lowered their weapons to gaze at the daunting site that dwarved them. With the Gulags largely preserved from war, however, this does pose a question: are we to close the site down forever and let it remain a relic of our barbarous past, or must we plunge our hands in the dirty realities of this war so that Russia may live on?"
 RUSwonder.7.a:0 "Sometimes, great men do awful things."
 RUSwonder.7.b:0 "Never again, not like this."
 
 RUSwonder.8.t:0 "Ural Automotive Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.8.desc:0 "With Chelyabinsk now conquered, our men sweep through the city in search of anything of value in the ongoing conflict with our neighbors. Raiding teams zip across streets, firing at the remnants of enemy divisions holding out in homes and buildings scattered across the urban sprawl, and crackles of gunfire echo throughout the streets from skirmishes a few blocks away. A unit of our men had besieged an encampment holding out in the Ural Automotive Plant, and upon breaching enemy defenses, the Plant was pried from the few dozen men left clinging to their lives.\n\nWith this major manufacturing site under our control, our soldiers will now have greater access to off-road vehicles in later confrontations. This has great potential to improve our supply lines, and aid in improving the speed of our reinforcements. The powerful engines produced in the Ural Automotive Plant are renowned for their speed and dexterity over difficult terrain, and will definitely prove useful in our navigational and incursive efforts across the Russian anarchy. Truly, with the aid of the motor, this is a victory for our people and the future of Russia."
 RUSwonder.8.a:0 "Onwards, countrymen!"
 
 RUSwonder.9.t:0 "Zlatoust Arms Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.9.desc:0 "The continued advance of our troops deep into the Urals has resulted in the capture of a great prize: the famed Zlatoust Arms Plant.\n\nLong known for turning out vast quantities of high-quality small arms and ammunition, the capture of the plant means that we can now secure these weapons for ourselves, while simultaneously denying them to our enemies. Already our engineers and administrators are working to integrate the plant's operations into our wider logistical network, and this should be completed shortly.\n\nAlthough it is in truth only one large factory complex, of which we already possess many, and it will not on its own produce a decisive amount of materiel, the value of the plant should not be underestimated. It is a symbol of Russian arms production, and it now belongs to us.\n\nIt is yet one more jewel in our crown, and we will leverage the economic, combative, and political advantages it promises to facilitate further advances and conquests, until such time as all the lands and peoples of Russia acknowledge our state as triumphant."
 RUSwonder.9.a:0 "Forward!"
 
 RUSwonder.10.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Lost!"
 RUSwonder.10.desc:0 "In our defeats across Northern Russia, the frontlines have pushed us out of the Vorkuta Gulag system and have effectively conceded the complex to the enemy. As we did retreat from the area, prisoners grew ever more feral and hysterical as they witnessed our defeat. The wild frenzy of conflict punished our men, and perhaps to the prisoners it was some kind of sick justice.\n\nWhilst we do have the opportunity to strike back, our men are tired and shaken by the evictions of war. The bitter chill of the arctic winds do not accommodate for the spirits of the defeated, and as honorable as our troops can be, the numbing cold could bring them no respite. We march to regroup in the frontiers of our territories, but with the wild panic of the gulags burned into the memories of our men, their courage for battle seems irrecoverable and may spell our coming defeat. "
 RUSwonder.10.a:0 "Someone will be shot for this!"
 
 RUSwonder.11.t:0 "Ural Automotive Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.11.desc:0 "Our men have fought valiantly in the city of Chelyabinsk, skirmishing with the enemy and braving the metal shred of gunfire, but their sacrifices were not enough to defend the Ural Automotive Plant from the advances of the enemy. The factory's machines continued to crash and clunk in the haze and chaos of war, exchanging hands as the frontlines danced from street to street.\n\nWe retreat away from the city to encampments in the surrounding wilderness, plotting our recapturing of the factory. However, until then, we are to expect that our adversaries will make use of their new toys to produce the same vehicles that had aided us in our battles in the past. Whilst this is not a dishonourable defeat, it is a defeat nonetheless, and one that could spell our doom as the enemy grows stronger with every engine produced."
 RUSwonder.11.a:0 "A great loss for us."
 
 RUSwonder.12.t:0 "Zlatoust Arms Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.12.desc:0 "The Zlatoust Arms Plant burns bright in the distance as our men retreat into the wilderness to regroup, and explosions of ammunition caches are audible from the frontiers of the battlefield. Defeat looms over the troops as they gaze at the crumbling fortress they had fought for days in to defend. Overcome with a wicked cynicism, many turned away and continued their march, bitter and defeated by the enemy.\n\nThe arms plant, whilst not completely destroyed, has come under enemy control and will most certainly be exploited to produce thousands of arms in the coming weeks. Although our men did gather all they could to carry with us away from the battlefield, it remains an unspoken truth as of now that we will begin to experience tight weapon shortages as the enemy approaches further towards our encampments outside of the city."
 RUSwonder.12.a:0 "We have certainly lost an advantage today."
 
 RUSwonder.13.t:0 "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Captured!"

Piling heaps of ammunition caches and supply crates onto the trains, we can deliver these resources to our frontlines far more effectively, as well as increase the speed in which communications can be delivered.

The laughter that would always follow a long day of hunting and tracking, when she would be congratulated by the hunters for expertly leading them through the dense brush.\n\nSasha waited there all day, confident that the hunters would, must, return. She had always been faithful to them, and could not fathom the idea that they would not show faith in return. Evening came, and she remained, curling as much as possible for warmth. Night fell, and she remained, watching the curious eyes of the many other predators inspect her from the treeline.\n\nWhen morning arrived on the second day, hunger came with it, and Sasha knew that her friends were not coming back. That there was no reason to stay here any longer, and she needed to hunt besides. But she had not forgotten her friends, and she knew that, wherever they were, they could not have forgotten her.\n\nSasha knew she had to go find them.

He had only been inducted into the Order a month before, and had not yet gotten used to the chill of dawn patrols.\n\nHearing a twig snap behind him, Vladimir whirled around, readying his rifle as he did so. Expecting a person, he was surprised to find a dog, missing one ear, and looking back at him with head cocked to one side. Letting out a nervous laugh, he re-shouldered his rifle and took a step forward.\n\n"Hello," he began, "you look lost. Are you lost?" The dog didn't make a sound or move to retreat as Vladimir knelt beside it and stroked its surprisingly coarse coat, feeling for a moment that rarest of emotions in the Russia: peace.\n\nAfter a short while the dog whined and pulled away, and Vladimir watched it until it disappeared beyond the horizon. He sat down on a stump, lit another cigarette, taking care to hold it tighter, and sighed.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, in a way everyone in Russia was a dog. Just as this dog had lost an ear, everyone in Russia be they raiders, civilians, workers, guards, or something else, had lost something. Russia was not a hospitable place. All that Russia offered to most of its people was hardship.\n\nBut maybe someday, like that dog, he and everyone else would find a simple kindness in their fellow man.

Feeling her hunger, Sasha moved to devour them, before years of rigid training stopped her in her tracks.\n\n"Look at that, Pavel!" the older man said. "A trained dog!" He laughed as he approached her, the sound reminding her of better times. Caressing her neck, he directed her towards the trail, picking up and offering the jerky to her as he did. She quickly ate what was offered, and knew what to do next, sniffing the deer trail and looking in the direction of the smell.\n\n"See, Pavel!" the older man exclaimed. "A tracking dog.

This wanderer has come to be one of the greatest enigmas in all of Russia.\n\nLittle is known about this enigma.

Others tell tales of a former Wehrmacht soldier, consumed by guilt and under a self-imposed exile, as a penance to the people he wronged. A few scant reports tell of a widow from a destroyed village, seeking to bring to others the justice she was denied. Whispers in the East speak of an American volunteer from the West Russian War, stuck in a land not his own but still doing good where he wandered.

Tales are told of the wanderer holding off entire bandit raiding parties single-handedly, liberated slaves from Perm tell of an angel of light freeing them from their shackles before disappearing into the night, and rumors have come even from Moskow of one-man raids on Nazi strongholds.\n\nIn the end, while many of these deeds are undoubtedly fictitious, the actions of this hero, this modern-day Bogatyr, have lit a fire of hope in the hearts of even the most trampled upon in Russia."

He sat on the lip of a small crater, looking out at the people he had passed by. Before he could get too far into his reminiscing, he heard a small sneeze behind him. Turning, he saw the source. At the bottom of the crater sat a small girl, no older than six years old. She looked up at him in shock, eyes wide. Looking around for the girl's parents he motioned for her to join him. "Come here, little one. Where are your parents?" he asked, still searching.\n\n"I... I don't know. I can't find them!" she spoke, her voice quivering on the edge of tears. Before she could break down in hysterics, the stranger held up his hand.\n\n"Come along, we will find them," the man took her hand in his and brought her down the hill. They spent almost an hour searching for her parents, but in the end, they found them. The two looked like they had been run ragged, their faces were twisted in panic. The little girl rushed from his side to her parents as they sagged in relief. Before they could thank him, he had melted into the crowd and disappeared."

He struggled to breathe as the particulates that the rock gave out seemed to collect in his throat, and he could feel his muscles weakening. It wouldn't be long now, he knew, until he would collapse and have to be dragged out of the dark tunnels and into the infirmary.\n\nHe also knew that he would be replaced in an instant, and some other poor slob from the work camp would be forced down into the darkness to dig the tunnels until they collapsed. Lev had been at this labor camp for almost two years. He had run afoul of some party bylaw or another and had been exiled to this hell. His breath was coming in shallow gulps at this point, he knew he was nearing the end. He might even be left to rot by the guards if he was especially unlucky.\n\nBefore he could make his next move he was stopped. In shock, he looked at the man who grabbed his shoulder. It was one of the guards, one of the mercenaries that were paid to supplement the garrison. Gently, the man took his pickaxe in one hand, with the other he pushed a canteen into his hands before motioning him behind the crew. The stranger then took his place on the line, swinging Lev's pick with a vigor that shocked him.\n\nLev sat behind the line and drank greedily from the canteen. His breathing returned to normal and the aches in his body seemed to lessen. After ten minutes, he returned to the line. The strange guard took the opportunity to take over for the worker next to him. The guard kept an almost supernatural pace, even as he slowly cycled through every member of the work detail he never seemed to tire. When the commandant called an end to the work for that day, Lev's crew walked out of the tunnels with smiles on their faces.\n\nThey would never see the strange mercenary again, he had collected his pay and left the next day, but they would always remember him for taking up their burden."

They had recognized his worn uniform on sight. A German dog, of the Wehrmacht no less, had dared to pollute Russia's soil with his filth. The most frustrating and infuriating thing of all, in Viktor's mind, was the man's actions. Unlike the filth who bombed the countryside, he was helping people. He defended families from bandits and slavers, and he aided farmers for only a pittance of food. The bastard thought he could be redeemed, but Viktor knew that the only redemption the pig would have is death.\n\nViktor and his men caught up with the man the next day and immediately began their attack. Despite having the element of surprise, Viktor found that the stranger was quickly turning the tables on them. Already, three of his men were dead and another two were wounded. He would not give up, however, until the bastard was dead. Viktor threw himself at the man, wrestling him to the ground and stabbing at him with his knife. However, before he could gut the pig, he felt a burning in his stomach. Viktor looked down at the cold steel embedded in his gut and slumped over.\n\nThe German got to his feet and approached him as he bled out into the snow. He reached down and dragged him to a tree. Viktor tried to fight back but he could hardly move. Then, the man began tending to his wound, cleaning it and applying bandages. When he finished, he stood and began to walk away.

Indeed, the library was one of the few places in all of Russia that could maintain and preserve the manuscripts of Russia's past.\n\nVadim Pevtsov had watched over the library since his youth before the fall of the old Union. Soon, it would be time for him to retire and allow his successors to take over. However, before he could, he had one last contribution to make. He sat nervously in his office, practically vibrating in his seat, as he awaited news from the man he had hired. It had been almost a month since he had sent the wanderer on a mission beyond the Urals. The man was to infiltrate Perm and return with the greatest bounty in all of Russia, the original Ostromir Gospel manuscript. The text was held hostage in Perm, a sign of legitimacy for the "Aryan" regime.\n\nAs the day turned to night, Vadim began to give up hope that the manuscript would be recovered. However, before despair could grip his heart the door opened. The stranger strode into the room, with a slight limp he noticed, with a duffle bag carefully cradled in his arms. Without a word, the man set the bag down onto his desk and opened it. He took the medieval text from the bag and gently placed it in front of him.\n\nVadim was frozen in shock and excitement. He had doubted the stranger's abilities and yet here he was, manuscript in hand. Vadim examined it closely, seeing for himself the damages wrought by the Nazi's neglect.

The comradery and nationalistic fervor that became a fact of life for the Reich's citizens.\n\nHe saw his mother, proud and beautiful, laid low by an illness that poisoned her blood. He remembered the doctor's face, sneering about her impure ancestry. It was the last he saw of her, before his conscription. "Serve the Fatherland in its army or die like the mutt you are, boy." The words of the Gestapo agent echoed in his mind.\n\nHis father, a proud soldier of the Reich, was arrested for polluting the Aryan gene pool and his wife's Jewish ancestry. He got the news of his execution on the front of the West Russian War.\n\nFinally it came to his victims. The brutality of the fighting in West Russia would stay with him for the rest of his life, he knew that, but it was the reprisal operations that truly haunted him. Villages depopulated by his unit.

This time though, the bandits had fought more akin to a Soviet Guards regiment than any bandit lord's troops. The battle had been fierce, and many brave souls had fallen, but the tenacity of the Guard could not be denied.\n\nAmid this raucous celebration, an anomaly could be seen. In a quiet corner of the bar, seated with some of the more grizzled veterans of the guard, was a stranger. The man looked almost painfully average. His eyes were a simple brown, and his hair was of a similar shade. Of his features beyond that none could remember, the vodka had flown liberally and left holes in their memories.\n\nThis stranger was an honored guest of the Kingsguard, as he had been integral to the Guards success in that fateful battle. Every once in a while, one of the younger men would break off and offer a drink to the man, and every time he would politely decline. Instead, he would buy the man who offered a drink and send them on their way. He spent the night in quiet conversation with the veterans.

Something strange passed in his eyes as he looked out over the waters. Pavel was curious, he had grown up in West Russia under the Tsar, and yet he could not for the life of him place Alexander's accent, as faint as it may have been."Well, you've certainly come a long way. Let me be the first to welcome you to Baikalia. It is a beautiful place, if you can ignore the tyrant... never mind." Pavel was quick to change the subject, in case the man was one of Yagoda's dogs. "Have any family?" Alexander looked pensive and a great sadness could be seen in his eyes for a moment."I did. They are gone now. It has been ten years." He seemed surprised at his reply.

Perhaps even more surprisingly was the fact that their idealism was not blind to the realities of the world. They knew how unfair the world was, but they fought against the darkness regardless.\n\nAs the stranger walked through the streets, observing the excitement and happiness that surrounded him, he could not help but be caught up in it himself. He was no socialist, but at the same time he could not help but understand the appeal. As he walked, a man in the uniform of Sablin's Red Army approached him, hands well away from his weapon. "Greetings Comrade! What brings you to our fair city?" he questioned with a smile. The stranger was struck by just how genuine it seemed to be. "I am simply passing through. I will be seeking lodgings for the night before moving on. I am heading east," he replied. He saw no reason to lie to the man, unlike in Yagoda's territories he was unlikely to be murdered for saying the wrong thing.\n\n"Very well, Comrade.

Yet he could tell that these divisions were fresh, exceptionally so. This is something that could take years to boil over.\n\nDeciding to put the tension out of his mind, the stranger walked down the streets until he came to a small hotel. Entering the lobby, he could see other road weary travelers sitting around the fireplace. Walking to the front desk, he ordered a room for the night and went to lay down. He took off his bulkier outer layers and laid down on the bed. As he lay there, his hand wandered to his left side where burn scars could be seen dominating his flesh. The man thought back to the night he got them, when he tried to play hero and finally follow his conscience for the first time in that damn war. It had ended with his body burnt and the people who he had tried to save dead.\n\nHe was broken from his reminiscence by a scream coming from the room next door. Without hesitation he had sprung from his bed, old service pistol in hand, and bashed in the door to his neighbor's room. Inside, a man in a White Army uniform had pressed a young woman to the wall, his pants already around his ankles and a knife against her throat.

A quailing Dutch housewife asked what it all meant in the broken German her husband had taught her.\n\n"Accordingly, in thirty days legal ownership of your house and land will be transferred to its original, prewar owner..." A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background.

While the era of armed warlordism may have ended, our people are finding new ways to act on these rivalries. One such method seems to be hockey.\n\nThe recent game between the Gorky Tankers and Kazan's Ak Bars has ended in chaos following a narrow 4-2 win for the Bars in the first game of the season. The people of Gorky have refused to take the defeat lying down kicking off a series of drunken demonstrations. The protests, which later led to rioting, involved an attempt to prevent the Ak Bars from returning to their hotel, the defacing of several locations across the city with offensive slurs against Tatars, and many incidences of looting and vandalism.\n\nThe damages following the event have totaled to a considerable sum, and many are concerned that it may have set a worrying precedent for future games, especially as the hockey season begins in earnest."

It is a new day for Russia, and begets the first time in over two decades that the scarred region seems to stand united in any real purpose, and behind any real cause.\n\nThe reaction from international onlookers to the cheering crowds is mixed, in Europe, many fear the Slavic revenge and the sudden possibility of retribution for their failures in the World War, while in America, many celebrate, leftists heralding this as the pendulum swinging back against the Nazis and Japan.\n\nIn Russia, however, the people are united.

Cheering crowds and marching soldiers can be seen in every major population center, with every village at least having one or two drunken militiamen waving the flag of this new union stumbling through its streets.\n\nIt is a new day for Russia, a new regime. The nation has experimented with monarchy, Communism and now, after its greatest defeat, ironically, fascism. Many look in surprise as the Russians seem to have adopted the same ideology as their most hated enemies, but at the same time many others see this as the natural reaction.\n\nTo fight your enemies, they say, you must become the enemy."

While many welcome an end to the cruelty and banditry that has been endemic to the nation's warlord era for long, behind a single autocratic military leader and his inner circle, Russia is now also a beast to be feared.

Currently, he was mopping the remains of some NKVD soldier's lunch off the mess hall floors. As low on the totem pole as he was, Pavel was almost invisible to the soldiers and scientists of the Black Mountain. Around him, their tongues wagged freely, and he soaked up the gossip like a sponge.\n\n"I hear the bosses are in talks with the fascists. They have demanded our subjugation, or so I hear. The bastards," came the voice of one man.\n\n"Yeah? I heard it was the Revolutionary Front, or those Black League maniacs," came the voice of another.\n\n"And I heard it was the ghost of Comrade Bukharin, risen again to wreak havoc against the Germans," came Dimitri's voice. Pavel liked Dimitri, he slid him extra rations every once in a while. "The point is, we shouldn't put much stock into rumors. Whatever the truth, we will follow our orders in the end."\n\nIt was true, of course, the NKVD troops would follow the orders that filtered down from higher up, no matter how heinous. Pavel remembered the screams and the bodies of those in the labs. He disliked when he had to clean those places. He could almost hear the damned souls in torment whenever he did."

Similarly, the clout we would gain in the political arena within Orenburg cannot be understated. If we can keep Orenburg independent, for the time being, we will deprive our enemy of important resources and ensure that the Communes are more willing to integrate in the future.\n\nWith that said, it is a risky proposition. If they do not back down, we could easily be drawn into a war we are not for. Similarly, the Communes are not likely to be any help of note in any potential fighting, as their small size ensures.

From what he had been told by Colonel Oborin, the bastards on the other side of the Urals were preparing to invade League territory.\n\nHe had known men from the Ural Guard, strong men and brave, every last one of them. The thought of abandoning them to their fate turned his stomach, and yet if that was the order he would have to go through with it.\n\nKonstantin turned from his position overlooking the border and walked back to his command tent. The only thing he knew for certain right now was that a request for assistance had been sent to the capitol and there was much debate among the higher ups on what to do. With a final sigh, he walked into the slightly warmer air of the tent.\n\nBefore he could do much, he adjutant had handed him a message, one marked for his eyes only.

His men were a motley bunch, made mostly of old backwoodsman and survivalists who had joined up for a steadier ration count. Despite their ragtag nature, they were loyal and very well disciplined.\n\nAt the moment, Nikolai's men watched as an NKVD man from the Black Mountain patrolled the village below. Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region - even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\nThe subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started. He could see men in a different uniform, a very familiar uniform, moving in on the village from the South. The NKVD forces within the village were bloodying their attackers, but were slowly being pushed back for their trouble.\n\nBreaking radio silence for the first time in almost three weeks, Nikolai contacted his commander. After explaining the situation he awaited his orders."

It seems the only way we will get ORenberg into our nation is through bloodshed.\n\nEven worse, the power on the other side of the mountains has sent word to Orenberg that they can count on their support if they stand for their independence. This means a war with Orenberg will almost certainly lead to them invading us in response. A war that we expect, but aren't quite prepared for.\n\nWe are limited to two options. Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We do not bother with endless debate like the communes. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough... would it be wise to wait?

The deal we gave him was not good enough, and his guard is prepared to resist us at all costs. It seems the Ural Guard does not fear us, and is prepared to try and fight us like they have against so many others. And, ordinarily, we would be happily obligated to challenge them.\n\nBut there is a complication. On the other side of the mountains, another power will back the Ural League up. They have forces that can match us, and they have the equipment to back the League up. It will mean a massive war with another major power, at an inopportune time.\n\nWe have two choices. Either we get involved with a massive war which will only end when the other power is defeated, or we slink off back to the shadows after being confronted by another claimant to Russia. It's really a matter of if we think we can win. Is a fight right now advantageous or not?"

It states, quite plainly, they will declare war on us if we attempt to enforce our demand in any way. This is, quite obviously, a big problem. Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

Once the war is over and our rival has been defeated this will make it easier to persuade the local governments that they would be better off integrating into our state.\n\nOur generals agree that we cannot risk humiliation by sitting the crisis out, but they do not believe it is worth coming to the rescue of the Ural states, pointing to our own plans to annex the region sooner or later. Instead they advocate for our own intervention in response. With the armies of the southern Urals already busy fighting our rival we would be free to sweep in and capture most or possibly even all of the southern Urals.

 ### Finland Diplo ###

 russiadiplo.37.desc:0 "In its short existence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland had rarely been inactive. Orbiting our former overlords in the east as we do, diplomacy has always had its place as the shield of our young nation. The Soviet war of aggression in the thirties had been feared, and diplomats had spent their entire careers trying to prepare for it. Now, the era of Russian unification has set a new crisis into motion.\n\nOnce merely one of many risible "government of national unity" , our opponent now stands on the border of our forward line in Onega. Every possible regional rival has been vanquished. Now this unifier has come for the last few pieces of Russian land in western Russia that is not directly shielded by the Germans. And they'll want it quickly, for our military analysts predict the rise of threatening rivals in Siberia and the Far East. The logic of unification demands that the government of western Russia plucks every low hanging fruit as quickly as possible.\n\nRather than use blunt force, this new western Russian state seeks to enter into talks with our government, and has proposed that a conference take place in Viipuri, Karelia. It is perhaps a mercy that this jumped up war band prefers diplomacy. But no amount of words can change the strategic situation that Finland stands alone, that our military buffer zone in Onega shields our population and industry from warfare, and that abandoning it without a fight might invite our future subjugation by Ivan. The Russian's bluster of a massive army crashing onto us does not change the fact that their army is equipped with scraps of decaying Soviet equipment, while ours is modern and well armed. This might be our best and only chance to delay or prevent the formation of a hostile government on our doorstep.\n\nIn the halls of the foreign ministry, there is constant dialogue. Hawks demand a general mobilization order. Doves beg the government to make use of this reprieve to open dialogue with the Russians and see what they desire. No matter our decision, the Russian ambassador waits wordlessly. He probably already knows what course of action we intend to choose."

 russiadiplo.38.desc:0 "It was perhaps inevitable that the Finns would refuse. The government of Finland isn't staffed by fools; the same reasons why our government desires Onega back are the reasons why they refuse to return it. Both of our nations desire to hold strategic ground that might prove essential in any future war between Russia and Germany, or between Russia and Finland. The Finnish generals remember the first winter war, where the Red Army eventually overran the Mannerheim line on the Karelian isthmus.\n\nA more bloodthirsty government than ours might have not bothered with diplomacy. If we cannot convince the Finns to see reason, then we can punish them for their perfidy. They have seen fit to enslave Russians for its protection, to hide in the shadow of the German hegemon. We will weep for the brave men of Onega, forced into servitude by cowardly Finns. But we shall shed no tears for Onega's backers in Helsinki."

 russiadiplo.39.t:0 "Finland Requests Our Terms"
 russiadiplo.39.desc:0 "The Finns are somewhat receptive to talks. Our ambassador informs us that Helsinki has agreed to a high level diplomatic conference between our two nations.\n\nIt is pleasing that the Finns have not done anything rash, and have agreed to at least give us some time to make demands. Some cynics in our government suspect Helsinki of merely stalling for time to order a full mobilization. The fact remains that war can be avoided. Before anything else, however, Helsinki wants to know our terms.\n\nOnega must be returned to us, its population freed from their janissary duty for Finland. That much is essential. This does not mean, however, that the Russo-Finnish frontier should remain a dagger pointed at Finland's heart. We could simply demilitarize Onega, and sign a nonaggression pact for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Finns would probably accept such a deal, and Helsinki would likely see it as too good to be true... Thus, a better deal would be the return of Onega in full, with our troops in the region. Eastern Karelia will be also be integrated to Russia as an autonomous region, with the Finns granted an open border into the region. This would return to us the arctic port of Murmansk. South-western Karelia and its critical city of Vyborg, or Viipuri in Finnish, would stay under Helsinki's control. Demilitarized zones and non-aggression treaties will follow, preventing any future war between our peoples.\n\nOf course, we could just demand it all. No matter how attached the Finns are to Vyborg and south-western Karelia, their paltry army cannot save them for long. Onega's ramshackle mob of conscripts will not slow us long, if they choose to fight their countrymen at all. The Finns will agree to our demands for Onega and all of Karelia, or pay for their arrogance."

To accommodate for Finnish population in the region, this land would be integrated into a new Karelian Autonomous Zone, sharing an open border with Finland and a minimal security presence. The borders of our nations would be demilitarized, and a treaty of non-aggression would guarantee a return to peaceful relations. Additionally, the rest of Karelia will be given limited autonomy under a Finnish administration, with military access and open borders to both Finland and Russia.\n\nAbandoning Kola and Muurmanni is seen as a bridge too far by many in our nation. This is a great deal of land, and many of our citizens have moved there and call it home. Refusing this deal might thus be in our best interests; the Russians might then reduce their demands to Onega if fate smiles on us."

This would be quite generous of us, considering the miserable failure of Red Army attempts to capture the city during the Winter War.\n\nThe Russian demands are no joke, however, for they are quite insistent that these demands must be accepted or rejected in their entirety.

Despite several attempts to reassure the Finns that we will not repeat the mistakes of Bukharin's Soviet Union, their negotiators have stayed on their position.\n\nIt might still be possible to scale back our demands to the return of Onega, sweetened by offers of a demilitarized zone and a non-aggression treaty.

 RUS_tourist.1.d:0 "With a compass in hand and butterflies in stomach, he gazed off towards the visage of Anchorage, rapidly shrinking away into the horizon. A game of cards, and a hearty serving of alcohol had certainly done wonders to feed his excitement and wanderlust while they were docked in port, but he had to admit, it was hard to get the yesterday's goodbyes out of his mind.\n\nHis mother's reaction had not surprised him, a quiet bout of sobbing and a laundry list of demands as they stood before the front door. She had been nervous for weeks, and in all that time he had done his best to reassure her. This was something he needed to do, he would take all available precautions, he would have all the necessary documents. It was a conversation that seemed to never end. No, he had resolved any lingering strife with mom. It wasn't her that was spawning such remorse in his sea-bound heart. Surprisingly, it was Dad.\n\nTo say his father was an enigma would be an understatement. Childhood memories existed beyond count; missed baseball games, absent birthday parties, one word responses to kindergarten art pieces.\n\nIt was not that dad didn't care at all, per say. From time to time, he would show his affection, teach his sons to replace a flat tire or two. The problem was consistency, or lack thereof. At any moment, Dad might disappear into the basement again, or a car would pull out of the driveway and return hours after family dinner had ended. He never knew what to make of it. Perhaps the war had simply taken too large a toll, created a man who could only function on whiskey and lonesome hours.\n\nSo when Dad burst into tears in front of the taxi, launched into a bear hug, and handed his son a compass and pistol subtly before the car door closed, he couldn't help but feel shaken. Was he really making the right decision, if it could affect a man such as that so greatly?\n\nUltimately, he brushed the thought away and returned below deck. There was no turning back now, and he had a great and exciting adventure laid out before him. He would return alive, and ultimately, changed for the better."

Determined but fresh-faced, it is hard to know if he will survive for long in the anarchy that Russia finds itself in, and up to us if he gets the chance to.\n\nLicking his lips, Ivan Yumashev's eyes skimmed the report once more, before he set it aside. Picking up a cigarette- a luxury these days, looted from a passing Japanese ship, he had heard- he proceeded to light it with his free hand. An American tourist, eh? That sure wasn't something you saw everyday. It might be worthwhile to come meet this American personally before he leaves, and give him a tour of the fleet. It might, for once, take his mind off of the sorry state of shameful piracy the Pacific Fleet had been reduced to."

 RUS_tourist.3.d:0 "Visiting Kamchatka was more eventful than I'd thought it would be. Sailors on military ships and on the docks alike stared at my boat as it came to a stop. When I told them I came from America, the sailors all seemed really excited for some reason, and a bunch of them wanted to shake my hand. I felt like a celebrity, almost. That feeling only increased when Admiral Yumashev, the leader of this 'Pacific Fleet' that controls Kamchatka, came to meet me in person. He said the city we were in was called Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and gave me a tour of his fleet. The admiral was really nice and patient, although his English wasn't great; he said he learned it back during the war, the big one, so he must be a couple decades out of practice. Still, it was better than nothing.\n\nSomething was off about the fleet though. The ships are outdated, but they must still need fuel and parts, which I didn't see any industry for, and I didn't see any trading vessels at the docks. I'd heard that the economy of Kamchatka depended on piracy, but I didn't think good men like the admiral and those sailors would resort to it. Still, I guess everyone needs to eat, and if half the things I've heard about the state of Russia are true I guess I can't blame them too much. At least Admiral Yumashev arranged for another boat to take me to Magadan."

We cannot let a naive American die in the wilderness, the least we can do is provide shelter for a few days.\n\nPerhaps Matkovsky could even meet with him! Being an American, he could be useful for reaching the leadership of the United States. We have always wanted a closer relationship with the Americans, so why not start now, when we have one right here! Matkovsky even believes he has connections to the CIA. What fortune!\n\nBesides, it would be a good way to show hospitality. The American ought to be impressed when he meets the true Vozhd of the Russians! No matter what, it would make a good impression will help us stand out besides all the other warlords surrounding us.\n\nHowever, maybe it could be a better and safer idea just to give him a general tour around Magadan. Letting him see the town will show him the true way of life in Russia better than any meeting with Matkovsky. Besides, the Vozhd is a busy man, and he may not enjoy wasting his time with a potentially worthless American. So, should we give him a tour of the town, or should Matkovsky invite him to a drink? "

He kept asking me about my connections to President Nixon and the CIA, weirdly enough. Maybe it's my hair?\n\nAfter I told him I was just an average American he seemed a bit disappointed. Then he asked about how life was in America and what I was doing in Russia. I told him I was a university student back home and I had come to visit so I could explore Russia and maybe have a little bit of fun and adventure instead of my boring life back home. I don't know what he said after that but I think it was something along the lines of how I'll be shot by the first bandit that gets anywhere near me, so oh well. Then I had a few more drinks and proceeded to tell him my dad was an astronaut in a secret mission to Venus as well as back in the war he had killed one hundred Japs with only a pistol. In reality, he's a mechanic and always has been. Matkovsky seemed to enjoy the story, however, although I don't know how much of it he understood. My Russian isn't the best.\n\nAfter our meeting he gifted me this enormous bearskin. I guess I should wear it? I already think I'm fine without it as I have my own fur coat but I accepted it anyway. It is very warm.\n\nNext I'll be heading up Yakutsk to see what is going on there."

The seaport is probably only big thing around. Still, there is a very cozy feeling about the place. A weird sort of cozy, because you can walk past a family enjoying a quaint meal and then look across the street and see a blackshirt officer beating up a hobo. Still cozy though.\n\nIt feels like Magadan is the only place around, even though I'm told there are a few more villages nearby. Still, it is certainly isolated, so I hope I can find my way to where I'm going next. There aren't many roads in Russia either.\n\nWhile we were touring I'm pretty certain I also saw a labor camp. Not sure if that was what it was but from the way my tour guide tried to keep me away from it, I'm pretty sure Magadan has a few populated labor camps. Hopefully, those will be the worst thing I see in Russia. From what I expect, however, some places may be far worse.\n\nOverall Magadan isn't all that bad. I do sure hope not all places are like this though. It seems the people have adjusted to the harsh life here. Some in different ways than others, but I'm glad I came. It's time to continue my trip, and I have a long way to go."

The man explained to us that he is an Ameican tourist visiting Russia, and presented proof to support his wild claim.\n\nWhile we have no idea what would possess a person, let alone a well-off American to do such a thing, he appeared to pose little threat and was sent on his way to Yakutsk. We don't expect him to live for very long given his inexperience, but the least we can do is show him around our humble republic."

 RUS_tourist.8.t:0 "Entry 3: Yakutia"
 RUS_tourist.8.d:0 "Crossing the river into Yakutia was less eventful then I expected. The border guards were initially suspicious before I told them of my intentions. I don't think they believed me at first but, after showing them my passport and the ticket I purchased to Magadan, they sent me on my way to the capital.\n\nYakutsk was peaceful if not densely populated. The people were friendly, but not particularly fond of their government. From what I gather, Yakutia is dominated by mining interests who have mostly bought out the politicians and who commonly mistreat their workers. The miners I met spoke of harsh working conditions and poor wages.\n\nAfter purchasing some supplies and gathering my notes, I said my goodbyes and left the capital. Beyond Yakutsk, I saw little beyond the odd village or quarry and mostly followed the Lena River to the "Partisan Republic" of Aldan.\n\nGiven what I've been hearing about Russia, perhaps hiring a guide or bodyguard would be a wise move. Most of those I talked to seemed skeptical of my ability to tour the entire country and make back to the States in one piece. Maybe some of the partisans would be willing to help me out."
 RUS_tourist.8.a:0 "They were peaceful at the very least."

 RUS_tourist.9.t:0 "A New Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.9.d:0 "Very few people willingly come to Aldan. It is cold, impoverished, and actively hostile towards one of its most powerful neighbors, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. As such, it was very surprising when some partisans reported a man carrying an American flag had crossed over from Yakutsk. Soon, it became clear that this really was an American, one who had decided to travel across the former Soviet Union and learn about its peoples.\n\nWhile one can certainly doubt his sanity for deciding to travel alone across a country that has broken down entirely into warlords and anarchy, our partisans did escort him across our small corner of Siberia, so that he could safely continue his travels. Unfortunately for the American, he will continue his journey by visiting the fascists of Amur next, after staying the night in Aldan."
 RUS_tourist.9.a:0 "Are all Americans this strange?"

 RUS_tourist.10.t:0 "Entry 4: Aldan"
 RUS_tourist.10.d:0 "Earlier today I crossed over into the territory of Aldan. Much like Yakutsk it was quite sparse, but not nearly as peaceful. Aldan is quite militarized, and apparently a large chunk of its population are partisans who are actively fighting for their freedom.\n\nCurrently, it seems that their efforts are focused upon fighting against the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to the south. As such, I have decided to visit somewhere less actively hostile, and visit Amur instead. I hear the government there is fascist, but the Magadan people weren't hostile towards Americans, so I should be fine.\n\nI also have decided that I'm going to need a guide to help me converse with the locals. Clearly my basic knowledge of Russian isn't going to help in places when I'm conversing with Buryats, or dealing with complex topics such as politics and whatnot. So, I hired a guide, a former partisan sniper by the name of Zoya Vasilevna Fedorovna (I think I spelled that right). She apparently arrived in the Far East when the Soviet government relocated, and has fought against the Germans. She isn't the friendliest, but she's experienced, and has traveled across much of Russia herself, so she seemed like the best choice for a guide. She has also repeatedly told me that visiting Amur is a mistake, but she's still willing to lead me there."
 RUS_tourist.10.a:0 "Hopefully things will go well tomorrow."

 RUS_tourist.11.t:0 "An American on the Border?"
 RUS_tourist.11.d:0 "Our men on the northwestern border, tasked with watching the mongrels in Aldan, have reported new arrivals.\n\nApparently a small party, counting among its number a Russian woman as well as a man claiming to be an American, has requested entry into our territory. The man claims that he is planning to travel across all of Russia, and would thus like to visit Zeya.\n\nOur men claim not to have found any reason to doubt him or his apparently legitimate travel documents. We must, however, be cautious. Although difficult and, thus, unlikely, it would not be impossible for a party of infiltrators from the renegades in Magadan or the relics in Chita to approach from the direction of Aldan in an attempt to find a border zone with weaker security.\n\nBoth groups would like nothing more than to see the Vozhd brought low, and put in chains. Or worse. If he truly is who he says, however, he offers a golden opportunity. Proving the strength and legitimacy of our government could potentially allow for us to gain more influence in the region, and would assist considerably in advancing our goals of regional, and eventually national, supremacy.\n\nThey do not seem to be planning insurrection against the Vozhd, but of course one can rarely tell the intentions of parasites, even if they were to make themselves known. What should we do with them?"
 RUS_tourist.11.a:0 "They are no threat. Let them continue to Zeya."
 RUS_tourist.11.b:0 "Arrest them. They are to be interrogated."
 
 RUS_tourist.12.t:0 "Entry 5: The All-Russian Government of Amur"
 RUS_tourist.12.d:0 "Although I am still working to improve my Russian, I am able enough to understand a tense situation. The kind of which we had while trying to cross into Amur.\n\nStopped by a border patrol of very rough-looking men, I found myself giving thanks to my earlier decision to employ Zoya's services. Through a combination of her rapid-fire Russian and my own documents we were allowed to proceed to Zeya, the territory's capital and the seat of the RFP's other Vozhd.\n\nI must say, when I was told in Magadan about how depressing a place Zeya in particular and Amur in general was, I was skeptical. But I am no longer. There is a pall of barely restrained violence hanging over everything, a feeling that, if one places their foot wrongly there will be immediate and severe consequences. I now well understand why Matkovsky's faction split from the one here.\n\nZoya and I have quickly established a beneficial working arrangement, even as we improve each other's language skills, and she has told me she feels the same. Neither of us particularly wish to remain here for any length of time, and so once able we will continue westwards, towards a land I am told maintains a pocket of old monarchism.\n\nAnd that has its own quarrels with Amur. I cannot imagine why.\n\nThat was a joke, Steve. Get better at writing sarcasm."
 RUS_tourist.12.a:0 "Leaving this place behind will be a blessing."

 RUS_tourist.13.t:0 "An American-Matkovskyite Agent?"
 RUS_tourist.13.d:0 "We made the right decision regarding the entrants from Aldan. The moment our men tried to arrest them, the woman, followed by the 'American' began resisting.\n\nAnd were, accordingly, immediately dealt with.\n\nOnce the bodies were disposed of, our men began investigating their belongings more closely. The woman had little of interest besides some Yakut trinkets and an ancient rifle from the western regions, but in the jacket of the false American a journal was found. And inside it was revelation.\n\nTrue to his words, the man did indeed appear to be from America, having entered through Petropavlovsk. His next stop after that, however? Magadan. Where he was not only welcomed within the city, but also had a personal meeting with the arch-traitor Matkovsky. We cannot know what they talked about, but given his subsequent journey, it no doubt involved us.\n\nThere have long been rumors of American support for Matkovsky and his faction, and the sudden appearance of this man has only strengthened them. Regardless, however, though we do not know what the American's ultimate goal was, we know he will not be completing it.\n\nWe can therefore take pride in our vigilance, knowing that another plot against the Vozhd's great mission has been foiled."
 RUS_tourist.13.a:0 "None will stop the Vozhd. Not even the Americans."

 RUS_tourist.14.t:0 "The Tourist"
 RUS_tourist.14.d:0 "There has been quite a stir in the city of Chita today, as a most unexpected kind of visitor has arrived in our territories from the East. Our border guards detained a young man who was initially thought to have been a spy from Rodzaevsky's gang, but as it turns out, he was actually a young American college student harmlessly touring the embattled wastes of Russia. Tourists are quite a rare sight indeed these days, but the potential dangers of Russia do not seem to have dissuaded him.\n\nAfter he was cleared and released, he eventually made his way to Chita, and began interviewing several of the locals. It didn't take long for news of this strange visitor's arrival to reach the higher rungs of the government, and now Tsar Mikhail II himself has expressed an interest in meeting this American. While we certainly wouldn't want to defy our divinely ordained sovereign's wishes, perhaps it would be for the best if he didn't speak to this outsider..."
 RUS_tourist.14.a:0 "We can schedule a meet, as long it is closely supervised..."
 RUS_tourist.14.b:0 "He can speak to the army instead."

 RUS_tourist.15.t:0 "Entry 6: The Man Who Would Be Tsar"
 RUS_tourist.15.d:0 "When I arrived in Chita, it was very obvious that this was a different environment to the one in Zeya. Although there were still soldiers on the streets, the people didn't seem nearly as afraid to go about their business in broad daylight. I thought I'd try and interview a few of these folks myself to try and get a feel for this place, but fate had something else in store for me entirely. One day, I was pulled aside by military guards on the street. I had first assumed that I was in some sort of trouble, but instead, they brought me to an opulent mansion not far from the city. As it turns out, the Tsar who supposedly rules this place wanted to see me personally.\n\nThe Tsar, Mikhail II, was not at all what I imagined. Firstly, he spoke fluent English with a distinctively British sort of accent. When I asked, he told me that it was actually his first language, and he was still learning Russian. Imagine that: the man who is supposed to be the emperor of Russia can't even speak Russian! He was quite humble as well, and seemed genuinely fascinated with my journeys, as well as the fact that I came here from America.\n\nHe became rather distant after I continued to talk about what it was like in America, and proposed instead to show me around the city of Chita. We had a lot of fun, but I couldn't help but notice some army types were following us at every turn. Come to think of it, the entire visit felt rather... off. Mikhail himself always sounded very nervous, and was constantly looking over his shoulder. Security at the mansion seemed way over the top for me. Were they trying to stop people from entering, or someone from leaving?"
 RUS_tourist.15.a:0 "Nosy Americans..."

 RUS_tourist.16.t:0 "Entry 6: Siberian Hospitality"
 RUS_tourist.16.d:0 "Chita was, by any stretch of the imagination, a breath of fresh air after the dreadful place I had come from. The people seemed relatively unafraid of the authorities and carried on without fear for their lives. At least at first glance, this so-called empire seems more civilized than those Nazi bastards back East. After a good night's rest in an unassuming hotel near the main street, I began interviewing some of the locals to get their perspective.\n\nMost were not very talkative, and pretty soon I had attracted unwanted attention from the soldiers keeping watch on the street. Looking back, I don't think I saw a single actual police officer during my time there. I was taken in for questioning by these troops, and was interviewed by what appeared to be some very high-ranking general types.\n\nThey were very rude, and did not seem too impressed with my story. The questions they asked were strange indeed: ranging from where I had stayed the night before to whether or not I had ever come into contact with their Tsar. I don't even know the guy, so I have no idea why they would think that!\n\nOnce the questioning was done, the guy in charge arranged for a truck to take me away from Chita and out of their territory. He finished off by saying he didn't want "nosy Americans snooping around where they don't belong." Certainly not the warmest of receptions, but I suppose it could've been a lot worse..."
 RUS_tourist.16.a:0 "One less problem to deal with."

 RUS_tourist.17.t:0 "An Opportunity from America?"
 RUS_tourist.17.d:0 "Our men along the border with the Whites have informed us that, minutes ago, a small party crossed into Buryatia, having departed from Chita.\n\nAmazingly, it is being led by an American, the very same one who, our propagandists inform us, is starting to gain a reputation. Apparently this man is intending to cross the whole of Russia, east to west, and stopping in as many states as possible, legitimate or otherwise. Though he poses no threat, he does offer an opportunity.\n\nOur struggle against the tyrants in Irkutsk is not well known outside of our lands, and support, diplomatic, financial, or otherwise, could be of significant assistance. If we can prove to this American that our cause is just, we could benefit. A longshot, to be sure, but many said that about our endeavor as a whole, and yet here we are.\n\nInvestment would be minimal. At the very least, the American is likely to be exposed to the revolutionary spirit of our people as he traverses our lands, and it has been suggested that a brief meeting with Sablin himself could compound this. Our leader's natural charisma is well-known, and with only a few minutes of his time it is possible, however unlikely, that should this American complete his journey a favorable portrait of us could be painted.\n\nSome claim that to even entertain such a notion is foolish, and beneath our notice, but many others urge us to seize the chance offered. What should we do?"
 RUS_tourist.17.a:0 "Invite him to meet with Sablin. We cannot pass up this chance."
 RUS_tourist.17.b:0 "A meaningless distraction. Let him sightsee."

 RUS_tourist.18.t:0 "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.18.d:0 "When we entered Buryatia, crossing the border from Chita, we, or rather I, certainly did not expect an invitation from its leader for a meeting. But that is exactly what we received.\n\nThe border guards had been suspicious, but not overly so, and allowed us to continue on to their capital at Verkhneudisnk without much trouble. Once we arrived, however, we were met with some very sharply-dressed officers, who informed us that Sablin himself wanted to speak to us. Or, rather, to me. What was more, I actually felt that the request was exactly that.\n\nSo, after of course accepting, Zoya and the others were well taken care of while I was shuttled ahead to his office. And, I must say, he seems a most impressive man. Almost impossibly young, with an easy smile, immense personal charisma, and an affable demeanor, I liked him from the start.\n\nI confessed to him that I knew little of the struggle he spoke about, the doctrinal split with the so-called 'tyrannical and bloodthirsty' regime in Irkutsk, but he seemed not to mind, saying only that he hoped, one day, that his state could open relations with America. Perhaps, he joked, with me as the Ambassador.\n\nI and we were shuffled out shortly after, but I found the whole experience most enjoyable. In addition, his men had given us several trinkets to carry with us, and Zoya had purchased several more from a small market besides.\n\nTomorrow we will depart for Irkutsk itself. I am curious to see if Sablin's characterization of it is accurate."
 RUS_tourist.18.a:0 "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.19.t:0 "Entry 7: The Buryat ASSR"
 RUS_tourist.19.d:0 "I was not sure what to expect when we first entered Buryatia. Those in Chita, government-affiliated or otherwise, had said nothing positive about it. A state in rebellion, yes, but also a state of communists.\n\nI feared the worst but, I am happy to say, have been pleasantly surprised. There is a certain energy about these lands that I have not yet found in Russia. A certainty that, whatever the future may bring, those here are fighting for something worthwhile, something better. A 'revolutionary spirit,' to hear them describe it themselves.\n\nI cannot say for sure if such is an actual thing, but the people here very much believe it to be so, and that seems to be enough for them. Zoya herself is very skeptical that any such enthusiasm could carry them to victory over a superior foe, saying that she knows 'very well' how much spirit counts for, but I can't share her pessimism.\n\nAs an aside, I have also noticed that people are treating me, treating us, differently. With more attention, deference, and approval. Apparently word of my journey has spread somewhat, reaching ahead of our travels, and is being received, by some at least, as a topic of great interest. The feeling is, to me, very strange.\n\nWe are soon to depart for Irkutsk itself, where we will no doubt see if the ones who control it are as tyrannical as those here claim them to be. I am curious to find out, in any case."
 RUS_tourist.19.a:0 "Surely not everything they say can be true?"

 RUS_tourist.20.t:0 "An American Sablinite?"
 RUS_tourist.20.d:0 "A message has been received from our agents in Sablinite lands, regarding the departure of individuals from Verkhneudinsk on a course towards Irkutsk.\n\nApparently an American, reported as having originally arrived in the Far East at Petropavlovsk via chartered vessel is, along with several others, now proceeding towards our territory following reception in those of the rebels. While we cannot be sure of his or his party's intentions, we can be sure that there will soon be a situation requiring attention.\n\nAccording to the NKVD, the American in question was received by Sablin himself, and though whatever messages or words may have been exchanged are currently unknown, such contact is inherently suspicious. We also cannot, at this time, confirm the political orientation of his companions in general, and in particular that of one woman who has been identified as possessing considerable geographical knowledge and combat ability.\n\nIt has been recommended by several officers that we treat the group in its entirety as having been suborned by Sablinite practices, and thus move aggressively to capture and deal with them as such. Others, however, have urged restraint given the presence of a known American who has achieved some notability - and thus position in the public consciousness.\n\nWhat order should be given to our agents?"
 RUS_tourist.20.a:0 "Arrest them, but be careful. We don't want an incident."
 RUS_tourist.20.b:0 "Arrest them, but be vigilant. Open fire if necessary."

 RUS_tourist.21.t:0 "Entry 8: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet"
 RUS_tourist.21.d:0 "Sablin and his people had been very clear that Irkutsk and the 'tyrants' that controlled it would not receive us warmly, unlike himself. And they were right.\n\nThe moment we reached the frontier we were intercepted, as if they had known where we would be. Zoya told me that that was, most likely, exactly the case, our movements reported upon by NKVD agents. Every time she speaks the acronym I can hear the venom in her voice, though I can tell that, as much as she hates them, she also fears them, and that alone is enough to make me do the same.\n\nI soon understood the effect they had on people. The agents were men, yes, but their eyes were cold and hard as they searched our belongings and, after flat orders, our persons, in the most invasive way possible. They accused us of being Sablinites, our denials to which were flatly ignored. Then they asked more questions, and I could tell Zoya was growing uneasy.\n\nA potential disaster was averted, however, when they began asking me questions about my travels so far, and I realized that, regardless of their words, they were treating us with more care than they would have otherwise, for I, we, are becoming known. Indeed, shortly after they denied us entry and ordered us to depart to the south-west.\n\nOur group has not seen the Presidium's lands, and it seems as if we never will. If they are represented by the attitudes of the men who detained us, this is a state of affairs with which I am content.\n\nWe continue onwards, in any case. Not that we have any choice."
 RUS_tourist.21.a:0 "A tense situation."
 
 RUS_tourist.22.t:0 "One More Grave"
 RUS_tourist.22.d:0 "Another message has been received by our agents stationed along the border, and it is not positive news for the Presidium.\n\nApparently, shortly after intercepting and detaining the American and his party, they began displaying extreme agitation to both the questions presented and the searches demanded. This agitation, especially from the still-unknown woman earlier identified by our agents in Verkhneudinsk, eventually led to disaster.\n\nClearly convinced, correctly or otherwise, that they were about to be imminently executed, the woman reportedly killed one of the agents, seized his weapon, and attempted escape. The fight was brief but violent, and the woman killed several more agents before being shot down herself.\n\nAssuming that such action proved the party's identity as Sablinite infiltrators, the agents proceeded to liquidate the rest of the party, including the American. The bodies and identifying materials were quickly disposed of.\n\nWhile we will need to take action so as to ensure that the final fate of the American cannot be attributed to ourselves, we can be confident that, once again, the NKVD has acted as the sword and shield of the Party and the state as a whole."
 RUS_tourist.22.a:0 "Vigilance cannot be neglected."

 RUS_tourist.23.t:0 "A Memorable Border Encounter"
 RUS_tourist.23.d:0 "Always vigilant for potential NKVD infiltrators, the border guards of the People's Revolutionary Council, themselves long-serving Red Army men, quickly spotted the small party approaching from the direction of Irkutsk.\n\nQuickly moving to detain the party, the soldiers quickly found themselves quite astonished at the story communicated to them, first in broken and strangely-accented Russian from the man, and then with more expertise from the woman. Investigating further, their astonishment only grew as the man's travel documents were inspected, and the group's luggage searched.\n\nEventually accepting the story given, and listening with amusement at the 'reception' the man and woman spoke of by the authorities in Irkutsk, the guards permitted them entry into the PRC, directing them towards Organ. They also informed them, right before sending a radio message, that if they were not observed there in short order, the consequences could be severe, indeed.\n\nAs the party disappeared over the horizon and along the road, the soldiers completed their patrol, returning to their barracks shortly thereafter. That evening, over army stew and cards, they spoke with wonder at just what could have possessed an American to go trekking across all of Russia, and what the odds of his survival were.\n\nTheir sergeant won, giving him no better than one chance in ten."
 RUS_tourist.23.a:0 "But still, a chance."

 RUS_tourist.24.t:0 "Entry 9: The People's Revolutionary Council"
 RUS_tourist.24.d:0 "After our most unpleasant experience with the Soviet authorities in the lands around Irkutsk, we continued southwards, entering the lands of the People's Revolutionary Council.\n\nApparently a 'state' created in Mongolian lands by Red Army remnants, its capital, such as it could be called, had all the character of a military camp. And just about the equivalent friendliness of one. We spent some time securing small trinkets and stories from the local citizenry, but beyond that there is, sadly, little of note to write about.\n\nOne thing it did offer, however, was the opportunity to dispatch a letter back to America. For a very reasonable fee, a trader who was soon to cross through Mengjiang and towards the port at Dairen agreed to carry some mail. I hope it is received reasonably soon.\n\nCompared to my interactions with the locals, the experiences I shared with Zoya in these lands were far more interesting. She is a most remarkable woman, capable of easily inserting herself into the cultures of the states that we visit, and navigating complex internal politics with seemingly little effort. She is also, as I have discovered several times now, excellent at sensing dangerous situations and working to either avoid them completely or defuse them before they turn violent. I am again thankful that I secured her services.\n\nWe are proceeding onwards, intending to cross the internal demarcation line between the Far East and Central Siberia. I am curious to see what states exist. We have already seen such a variance in government here, and I wonder if this experience will continue.\n\nI hope it does."
 RUS_tourist.24.a:0 "A valued companion."

 RUS_tourist.25.t:0 "A Chronicle from the East"
 RUS_tourist.25.d:0 ""Dear Mom and Dad,\n\nI'm alive! Or at least I was when I wrote this letter and in good shape. We're currently camped out in western Mongolia, and I guess that means I've successfully trekked through the Russia Far East. While I'd love to tell you about it in person, a letter will have to suffice for now.\n\nKamchatka turned out to be run by the remnants of the Red Navy. Its sailors were quite friendly, and their leader was even kind enough to grant me a boat to Magadan. Unfortunately, they've been forced to resort to piracy to make ends meet, given the region's desolate conditions. Magadan in comparison was fairly well off, its people look adjusted to their harsh conditions, and their leader Matkovsky seemed like a nice fellow.\n\nAcross the border, the Yakutsk republic was dominated by mining companies, and while peaceful it was sparsely populated. Following the river, I arrived at the "Partisan Republic" of Aldan. A state opposed to most of its neighbors and heavily militarized. It was here where I hired Zoya, an experienced sniper, as a guide to help me on my journey.\n\nCrossing from Aldan into Amur, I entered into a territory ruled by thugs and murderers, where violence and brutality were common and unrestrained. Counting myself lucky to avoid injury, we crossed into Chita, a territory ruled by forces that seem to think the Russian Civil War still isn't over, with a Tsar from Australia at its head.\n\nFinally, we crossed into Buryat, a land of idealistic revolutionaries fighting against the last tyrannical remnants of the Soviet Union in Irkutsk, a paranoid state which deported me into Mongolia, now run by the remnants of the Red Army.\n\nWhile I still have a ways to go before I can get back home, Russia is a fascinating land, and I only hope that with Zoya by my side, I can traverse it all. Wish me luck, guys and I'll hopefully see you soon,"
 RUS_tourist.25.a:0 "Love Steve."

 RUS_tourist.26.t:0 "A Fresh Face in the Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.26.d:0 ""An imperialist spy," muttered Yuri, "has to be". The ideologue of the Siberian Black Army had been pacing up and down his room, flicking through the pages of reports that had been trickling in from the border communes. An American, they claimed, had penetrated the border with a Russian guide (most likely a Reactionary collaborator) and had been visiting the communes. Yuri studied the papers again, his eyes skimming over the Cyrillic type. This stranger was spinning an outrageous story about being a 'tourist', which was likely simply a thin cover for a CIA operative.\n\n"Maybe," interjected Stepanov, "he's just a tourist. Honestly, Yuri, I respect your spirit but I doubt the CIA would send a college student who clearly hasn't seen a day of war or labor as a spy." Galanskov's eyes narrowed at his military counterpart's words.\n\n"Perhaps he's here to spread authoritarian propaganda about how wonderful his capitalist hellhole 'democracy' is." Yuri's reply seemed far less fiery than his initial words, Stepanov's assessment cooling his choler. The ideologue's face softened, "No, Companion Ivan, you are probably right. Still, it could be beneficial to detain him and ascertain his true reasons for being here." He smiled slightly, "perhaps even arrange to have this tourist given a tour of our way of life, ignite the fire of anarchism within him that he might carry it back to America?"\n\nStepanov nodded, the idea had merit, but it wasn't up to either of them to decide, such was the way of anarchy."
 RUS_tourist.26.a:0 "Give him free rein."

 RUS_tourist.27.t:0 "Entry 10: The Free Territory"
 RUS_tourist.27.d:0 "Me and Zoya have been in the Siberian Free Territory for about a week now, lots to write down. In the states, I was always taught that 'anarchy' was a bad word, like total chaos. This anarchy isn't what I expected and I'm having a hard time sorting it all out. Everyone lives in communes and are led by councils, which are elected by the locals. I made the mistake of asking if that made the Free Territory a democracy and some young guy in a black and red hat started yelling at me in Russian! Zoya translated for me, and this dude was going off on me about how democracy was just a 'veiled authoritarian mechanism', whatever that means.\n\nTo their credit, people seem generally content with the way things are, but their reactions to me have been pretty mixed. I've been stopped a couple times by excited villagers who smile and take pictures with me, but just as many times I've been jeered at, spit on, and I swear that I've seen uniformed men following me! I don't know what to make of this place. The people are definitely free, but the way they define freedom isn't something I'm used to. They share everything with each other, have total gender and sexual equality, but also live under a military junta. I came here not really knowing what anarchism was, and I don't think I understand it any more now."

 RUS_tourist.28.t:0 "Entry 10: The "Free" Territory"
 RUS_tourist.28.d:0 "What a horrible day. I was out in town, just seeing the sights when a group of black-uniformed goons grabbed me and dragged me away through an alley! Zoya was busy with negotiating a ride to the next commune on our list and must not have seen me getting snatched. The thugs took me to a shack on the outskirts of town and interrogated me in a mix of broken English and Russian. I didn't understand much, but I think they were accusing me of being a CIA spy! They didn't torture me or anything, just roughed me up a bit, so I guess that's the silver lining. I was there for a couple hours, I don't know how long, but eventually I heard Zoya shouting at the guards in Russian. They started shouting back, but eventually, Zoya got them to let me go. She escorted me out, and I swore she was going to burst a goddamn blood-vessel, she looked like a giant cherry in a shirt. Would have been funny if I wasn't scared shitless.\n\nAfter that shitshow, she took me aside and told me that I should just avoid talking to the locals altogether. Apparently, I had used some 'imperialist language' and a paranoid anarchist fanatic ratted me out to the Black Army. They put two and two together and came to the conclusion that I was a spy. Apparently, freedom here doesn't extend to thinking big bad imperialist thoughts or using words that are 'un-anarchist'. Man, screw this place."

 RUS_tourist.29.t:0 "An Interesting Opportunity"
 RUS_tourist.29.d:0 "Frontier guardsmen, stationed along the border with the Black Army, have reported the detainment of an unusual group of entrants.\n\nThe entrants, initially observed rapidly exiting the Black Army's territory and entering our own, were immediately detained on suspicion of their origins. They were then searched and interrogated for evidence of anarchist literature or leanings.\n\nHowever, it soon became evident that they were not anarchists at all, but rather the entourage of a singular American tourist, himself also detained, who is attempting to cross Russia from east to west while compiling a log of all the states visited. It was immediately suggested that this offered considerable opportunity.\n\nIf the American is invited to Krasnoyarsk, if he can be shown the dedication of the Provisional Government to democratic ideals, and our intent to spread them over all of Russia, we could potentially win a very significant diplomatic victory. Gifts will of course be arranged.\n\nWe will therefore escort him to Krasnoyarsk, as well as arrange both a tour of the city and an audience with General Andreev. We will show him why our state is superior to those around us, and in so doing, prove that the lands of both the anarchists to the east and the madman to the west would be far better served under our control.\n\nIt is most pleasing when such an possibility presents itself."

 RUS_tourist.30.d:0 "After that unpleasantness in the lands of the Black Army, for which I will always give thanks to both Zoya and my earlier decision to contract her services, we crossed the Yenisei as rapidly as possible and were immediately detained.\n\nThe soldiers, claiming to represent the government in Krasnoyarsk, heard our story and contacted their commanders. Shortly thereafter, and to our surprise they told us we were to be escorted to Krasnoyarsk proper. Zoya was uneasy at the prospect, but clearly not having a choice in the matter, we conceded.\n\nI am happy to say, however, that her unease was unjustified. Krasnoyarsk is a most pleasant city, and as we were escorted through it towards what I now know to be the central government building, all I could see were clean streets, industrious people, and the largest railway junction I have ever seen.\n\nArriving at the government building we were met in person by, and I do not exaggerate, the territory's ruler, General-President Andreev. As one could be forgiven for assuming, I had thought a military-dominated government would be unpleasant, but speaking to the man about my journey and his own goals, I was surprised how dedicated he seems to be to the ideals of democracy, free trade, and more besides. I hope he is successful in his eventual reforms - liberty is of course deserved by all.\n\nWe make next for Kemerovo, to the west and across the Tom. Those here in Krasnoyarsk are quick to speak negatively of the city, the state it resides in, and its ruler, but I have learned by now that what people say is often not entirely representative.\n\nIn any case, we shall certainly see."

 RUS_tourist.31.t:0 "A Strange Arrival"
 RUS_tourist.31.d:0 "An odd occurrence has been reported to us from our security forces arranged along the border with Krasnoyarsk. Apparently an American, of all people, appeared and subsequently requested entry into the Principality!\n\nAlthough initially detained on suspicion of being an infiltrator from Andreev's traitorous regime, the man provided ample proof of both his American citizenship as well as his continued journey across Siberia, from Petropavlovsk to, so far, Krasnoyarsk. He further explained that he is on a journey across Russia from East to West, visiting as many nations as possible and investigating their cultures.\n\nWith no reason to detain the American further, and no instructions from the central government to reject entry, he was permitted to continue through the border region. He is expected to arrive in Kemerovo itself in short order."

 RUS_tourist.32.d:0 "When I first crossed into Kemerovo, I thought that everything I had been told in Krasnoyarsk was true - the border guards were most unfriendly until I proved who I was. But having now been in Kemerovo for a few days, I see that things are not as I thought they would be.\n\nThe city is clean and orderly, as long as you ignore all the coal dust from the Kuznetsk basin, the people seem relatively friendly, and I'm certainly not seeing all the unpleasantness I did in Zeya, Irkutsk, or in the territory of the Black Army. Zoya certainly seems to enjoy it, at the very least.\n\nFar stranger than the city, however, is the government. As far as I can tell their ruler is a Red Army general who had a breakdown and began calling himself 'Emperor' Rurik II, and it doesn't seem like anyone can really explain to me what his actual goals are. The ones they can tell me about, however and very loudly, are his children - 'Prince' Yuriy and 'Princess' Lydia.\n\nYuriy seems to have some ideas similar to Valery regarding unions and the like, and wants to move towards a democratic system. His sister seems much harsher, wanting to continue absolutism and claiming it a simple necessity towards keeping order in a place as lawless as Siberia. It shook me a little how much sense that made to me - before I set sail I would have supported Yuriy absolutely, but after what I've seen so far in Siberia I can't discount Lydia's opinion so easily anymore.\n\nIn any case, I've spoken with Zoya and tomorrow we'll be heading south, towards Biysk, apparently the capital of a small nation of Orthodox Old Believers. I wonder what that will be like."

Neither could they be locals heading either to church or to the day's festival. In front of the group was a woman, clinging to her rifle. Next to her was a foreigner with a dreadful Russian, claiming over and over to be an American.\n\nAs often was the case, President Zavoloko was the one to break the deadlock. He asked for fresh clothes to be provided to the group. The foreigner would stand out much less in traditional Altay clothes. From there Zavoloko had the American shown to a local church. In late afternoon he would be free to attend a local Burkhanist festival, where songs would shared under Oyrotia's endless sky.\n\nThe bodyguard was welcomed in for questioning. After assessing that the group really were just travellers, and had no tie to any Central Siberian factions, Zavoloko politely requested from the woman as much information as possible on Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk and the Siberian Black Army. The region was waking, and dark clouds were on the horizon. Any information as to developments in Central Siberia was welcome in the isolated republic."

I was invited to a festival, where songs and burning of sacred plants were carried on. I didn't understand much of the rituals, but there did not seem to be any shaman leading proceedings. It was a more communal sort of ceremony. The locals seemed indifferent to my presence.\n\nThe capital of the republic is not too different from any provincial town I've seen so far. Unlike Kemerovo or Krasnoyarsk, it seems this region has merely been forgotten by events. Isolated here in the mountains, it seems the two peoples of the republic want nothing more than peace and quiet. The lack of border guards and military checkpoints was commented on by Zoya. Hopefully peace continues to safeguard these people.\n\nWe've been sold horses! At a good price, too, it seems. It will help us make good time as we go down the mountains and head toward Novosibirsk.

The traveler looked both incredibly like he belonged with the caravan, and yet incredibly out of place due to his body language and general appearance. Regardless, he was trading alongside our citizens and seemingly happy.\n\nAnd then he ran into some soldiers. Soldiers who he did not stop talking to.\n\n"My name is Steve, and I'm a tourist from America! I've heard of the aircraft plant here, and have seen your planes soar all throughout this part of Siberia! They're absolutely fascinating to me."\n\nWhile his Russian was rather broken and he could barely hold a coherent conversation, he was traveling with a native who explained his situation. Zoya, as she was called, gave context to Steve's story and explained his desire to travel the Russian warlord states in order to document his experiences. Of course, the soldiers wouldn't pass on an opportunity for some entertainment. They offered to take him to the capital, where they would "commandeer" an aircraft.\n\nSteve and Zoya generously accepted, and the soldiers decided to drive them to the capital. While on the way, Steve was spinning eccentric, heartfelt tales about his previous travels from Eastern Siberia. This enchanted most of the soldiers, yet two of the most serious of the bunch, Evgeny and Anatoly, were infighting about which plane to take the young American up in.\n\n"I'm telling you, Anatoly! He would love the old Soviet Il-10. Americans eat up that historical stuff."\n\n"Nah, nah! Amerikanskiy love fast and dangerous! We should take out the jet plane that Aleksandr was working on."\n\nAfter much debate, the two come to a consensus with the other soldiers alongside Steve, and decided that..."

Almost shot down in a fierce dogfight over Moscow, she was valiantly spared... or so my pilot Evgeny told me. Whether this was true or not, I did not mind. The only thing that mattered was my head among the literal clouds and his comfort in this old piece of history.\n\nWhile we stayed within the borders of Novosibirsk and mostly along the Ob River, the sights and sounds of the serene Siberian countryside are absolutely breathtaking to behold from the sky, and it is surely something I will never forget, nor can do justice in this entry. When we landed, Evgeny gave me a brotherly hug goodbye, and gave me instructions to safely head to Tomsk.\n\n"Travel safe, Tovarish. May your journey be marked with heartfelt success."

Despite the occasional threat by warlord raiders, it was a surprisingly normal day in the average Novosibirsk town.\n\nUntil, that is, a jet fighter slammed into the farmland of Mr. Kravchenko and subsequently burst into flames on impact. Some may have thought it to be a lone, lost German bomber which had wandered way too far and was shot down by the Free Aviators, while others thought it was a simple air training exercise gone wrong. On closer inspection, the aircraft was either an experimental Soviet jet which never got off the ground, or a makeshift science experiment by one of the warlords in their vain attempt at air supremacy. Regardless, the smouldering wreck of what is left makes it impossible to discern.\n\nAfter an examination, the village constabulary has determined that three bodies were on the plane, all of which perished during the crash or the subsequent engine explosion. One of the corpses, although brutally disfigured, was an interesting case. The diary he was clutching to his chest was badly burned, yet contained stories of other warlord states throughout Russia in a language which the village intellectuals determine to be English.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the loss of most of the pages to fire and the overall integrity of his diary, it seems his story will be lost to the very flames which burned his mark on this world away."

Never has an American traveled so far into Siberia for years! Almost everyone in the city has a desire to meet him, and he has gained a fair bit of fame. We have even set up plans for him to view a debate in the salons as well as showing him into the insights of our unique government. As an American, he will surely be impressed with Russia's most powerful democracy, won't he?\n\nNevertheless, we must commend him on his willingness to learn.

Almost everyone wanted to meet me and have a discussion. I don't think I have been anywhere else that spoke more about politics, science, and art than here in Tomsk.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I even got a little insight into how Tomsk operates myself. I was invited to view a salon, and to be honest, it was entirely baffling. I had no idea what was going on. It was all just a bunch of intellectual conversation and scholarly arguing. I couldn't even figure out what they were talking about, and my Russian has gotten far better than when I arrived here in Russia! While I may not really understand this place, but it's good to know there are democracies in Russia and not just warlord dictatorships ruling over the people. Maybe Russia does have hope...\n\nStill, I don't know how they all agree on anything. It's much more enjoyable outside in the city of Tomsk than in the salons.

The companion, while not a local to the Western Siberia area, is clearly a native Russian. Cadre 120996, assigned to protection and border security duty, raised a complaint to their local officer in the League about this strange traveler. The commanding officer of the Cadre expressed caution, but out of sheer curiosity allowed passive interrogation and conversation with the traveler. He revealed himself to be a man called Steve, traveling the Russian anarchy with a guide who refers to herself as Zoya. Steve is documenting his experiences and the individual stories of the entire span of the country, of which his current stop is the great city of Omsk.\n\nWhile we are indeed overly cautious about visitors; especially ones as eccentric as an American tourist mad enough to traverse the warlord states, the commanding officer of Cadre 120996 has instructed his men to give the tourist some "friendly advice", and to show him around the city a bit.

Despite the protests of Zoya (she refers to me as a "Mudak" in private later amid other chastising), the Black League shows us important cultural sights, an insight into how their society works, let us watch a military drill, and took us to a lovely local stew shop run by an old man called Pyetr. After this, the Black League hurried us to a local Hostel underground as to not be accosted by the Luftwaffe nor be out and about in the city late at night. The beds we slept in were sturdy and comfy, and despite the fact that we were essentially sleeping in concrete subway tubes, everything felt homey and warm.\n\nThis morning, we are to travel toward the Urals the way of Tyumen alongside a military caravan. Zoya tells me that it's essentially a glorified raid. While cautious, I severely doubt that the Black League would send a traveler they have treated so warmly into live combat.

It is clear that this "Steve" is nothing but another obstacle; a test to the people of Omsk sent by the corrupt Western superpower to stop our soul-wrenching progress toward the Great Trial. His recorded observations are nothing more than petty espionage, espionage which will be sold to an American-backed warlord and used to crush us. Every notation that he makes rolls our clock forward, and our League cannot afford that.\n\nFortunately, "Steve" has reinforced his lack of intelligence and overconfidence during his fleeting few minutes here. About a half hour after the confrontation with Cadre 120996, "Steve" wanders into Bunker 2938 in order to find some information and a potential place to spend the night. Cadre 482315 has reserved most of that bunker for interrogation of individuals who have sought harm to the Russian nation. One such wastrel, an intellectual by the name of Yusef, happened to barely make a futile attempt at freedom. Escaping from his binds, the now half-blinded scoundrel could not see "Steve", yet still called out to him. His fingers individually broke and his spirit broken, Yusef would stumble into a horrified "Steve" as he collapsed to the ground and expired from shock. A few moments later, League members from Cadre 482315 would shoot two bullets from a TT-33 pistol into the back of "Steve's" skull.\n\nHis companion, Zoya, was found fleeing from Cadre 384234 after hearing this exchange from outside, and was swiftly executed with eleven PPSH shots.

They didn't like me very much. They stalked us and I got accused of being an "authoritarian," which was just madness. I'm American! We're as free as it gets! The city of Krasnoyarsk was much more pleasant. It wasn't big, but it was clean, industrious. The man in charge, Andreev, was very personable. He wants to set up a democracy, but for now it's a military junta. To the west was Kemerovo. I didn't meet the ruler - some old Red Army general that thinks he's an ancient Russian king, which is weird - but the people were nice. After that I went to Oyrotia, a small nation of Altaic people (one of Russia's ethnicities, like the Indians back home). They were very down to earth and sold me some horses and a beautiful cloak I can't wait to show you. Novosibirsk, on the other hand, is a big city, kinda like Baltimore. They took me up in an old Soviet warplane and Ma, it was breathtaking. The ride of a lifetime. The last place I visited was Tomsk, which is run by a bunch of those intellectual types, but at least it's a democracy.\n\nI'll write again as soon as I can.

The intruders do not match any known previous classification parameters for infiltrators. Their appearance and attire is unconcerned with camouflage, their mode of transport, that of horseback, is too conspicuous, and their path is exposed, providing no concealment. In addition, the party is carrying a raised American flag, further increasing visibility.\n\nIt has been suggested by subordinates that such a radical change in potential tactics of infiltration is likely an attempt to discover operational practices and procedures, or similarly as an attempt to capture security forces for information extraction. However, previous efforts on the part of the league to do so have focused on covert abduction, and were such to be attempted by the intruders as observed, long-range fire would likely ensure rapid neutralization.\n\nI await orders on how to proceed with interception.\n\nIn defense of the Central Committee,\n\nG.A.

But, as we soon discovered, and much to our peril, that healthy communist paranoia is still alive and strong.\n\nWhen I saw the border patrol approaching, I naively assumed that they would, like in so many other of the states we have crossed, cautiously advance, ensure we were not hostile, and then check our documents. They completed that first step, but then, and without even so much as speaking to us, proceeded directly to shooting. And if it had not been for Zoya using her practiced eye to read their body language, my story might have ended there.\n\nFortunately for us, she later told me, they had not waited long enough to both ensure accuracy and also prevent escape. We all immediately took off, pushing our horses to their very limits in order to remain ahead of the vehicles driven by the border patrol. Again Zoya proved her considerable skills, quickly identifying terrain that the horses could progress through, but the vehicles themselves could not. After several hours of hard riding, with the horses pushed to utter exhaustion, and using my continued ability to write as evidence, we succeeded in evading our pursuers.\n\nClearly unwelcome in these lands, we progress in the only direction possible - north - skirting the lands of those strange democrats in Tomsk.

Zoya says they're being careful, and that German infiltrators have tried to sabotage them before.\n\nThe one thing we have seen, from a distance and through my binoculars, was a group of biplanes performing some exercises in the distance. I must say, I can see where the stories about the Aviators' flying prowess come from - I've never seen planes turn so radically, or fly so low, and come out unscathed. I suppose you would have to be incredibly skilled in order to fly wood and canvas machines powered by tractor engines against the Luftwaffe for years on end.\n\nWithout any contact with the Aviators themselves, we're continuing west, where I've been told there is an entire region under the control of a vicious bandit clan.

They resisted as strongly as they were able, but were killed soon after, their tactical position near-hopeless.\n\nApart from one of their number, a woman with a rifle identified by one brother as bearing the marks of a formerly-active anti-German partisan organization, and who killed two brothers, the intruders proved easy prey. After the fighting had ended, the party stripped the bodies and rolled them into a shallow grave before searching the baggage train and butchering the horses.\n\nUpon inspection, there were a number of items and curiosities of great interest to the brothers, including products from all across Siberia rarely seen anywhere near the Urals. In addition, it would seem that the American flag observed earlier - which was also recovered - belonged to one of the intruders who was, surprisingly, carrying an American passport.\n\nIncredibly, he was also carrying a diary recounting his travels across the vastness of Siberia and Russia proper, crossing the territory of many different states and meeting many different personalities.

And so, when I turned to Zoya after looking over that cold land and shook my head I could tell, from her eyes alone, that I had made the right choice.\n\nWe are therefore returning south, moving towards Sverdlovsk. We shall have to cross the Thief Territory once again, but we will be fast and vigilant this time. Zoya is confident we will not be ambushed a second time if we do so."
 RUS_tourist.53.a:0 "A feeling of certainty, at the edge of the world."

 RUS_tourist.54.t:0 "An Irregular Occurrence."
 RUS_tourist.54.d:0 "A most curious incident has occurred along our northern borders. A detachment from the 364th Rifle Regiment intercepted a significant force of bandits from Yugra who were in pursuit of a peculiar group waving the American flag.\n\nAccording to the testimony of Lieutenant Romanov, the group appears to be mostly composed of deserters from Yagoda's Far Eastern Soviet, but most curiously seems to be headed by an American of all people. The American, who goes by "Steve," told Romanov that he was a tourist who was exploring Russia and presented proof to support his wild claim, including a genuine American passport and a ticket to Magadan.\n\nWhile some in the group appeared to seasoned veterans and may have posed a threat, Romanov deemed "Steve" to pose little risk to the District and escorted the group to Sverdlovsk."
 RUS_tourist.54.a:0 "An American? Well, it won't hurt to show him around."

 RUS_tourist.55.t:0 "Entry 21: Sverdlovsk"
 RUS_tourist.55.d:0 "Zoya had told me that Sverdlovsk had broken away from the West Siberian Republic under the rule of Marshal Rokossovsky, the so-called "Lion of Siberia." While she knew little of their rule, she had heard that Rokossovsky governed with a much lighter hand compared to the Leninists in Tyumen. Considering their patrols haven't fired at us on sight, I'd say she heard correctly.\n\nAfter a short interrogation during which I recounted my tale of being a Yankee tourist and presented some documents prove it, I, along with the rest of the group, was escorted to Sverdlovsk proper albeit under armed guard.\n\nWhile our group was under constant watch, life in Sverdlovsk seemed quite tolerable. The soldiers were friendly, and the people seemed content under the rule of the Marshal. We were provided with adequate accommodations in a local barracks and treated to a passable meal. Not as good as what we were given in Omsk but a definite step up from eating canned food while freezing in the Urals.\n\nThe next morning, we were treated to a parade by a rifle division. It was quite a sight, rows upon rows of well-disciplined soldiers marching in near lockstep, punctuated by a 21 gun salute from an artillery battery. For sure, it's a damn sight better than what the Minnesota National Guard regularly shows off. I think Zoya and the others thought so too - she said that the last time she saw a parade like this was years ago, right before the Siberian War between the Far Eastern Soviet and the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nAfter spending a bit more time in the city and purchasing additional provisions, we said our goodbyes to Sverdlovsk. Our next destination is Zlatoust, who I've been told are arms dealers of some repute, Zoya says we shouldn't expect any trouble, and I am quite eager to see what a country run by gun-runners looks like."
 RUS_tourist.55.a:0 "Not bad, but Omsk was better."

 RUS_tourist.56.t:0 "An American, Westward Bound"
 RUS_tourist.56.d:0 "While it would be a lie to say that tensions between Zlatoust and Sverdlovsk didn't exist, the borders are open for trade, travel, and tourism. The city of Sverdlovsk proper is rather close to our own Novouralsk, which has become a hub for caravans, travelers, businesses, and refugees to set up along or travel on; as long as they pay, of course. Late last night, however, two people on foot were traveling to Novouralsk, with one carrying an American flag behind him. Marching stalwartly toward our border, it attracted curious looks from some of our guards, and chuckles from most of the others.\n\n"Hello there! My name is Steve! I would like to travel through the Zlatoust Republic to experience the unique situation it is in and the many attractions it offers to its citizens!" Most of the guards were smiling, and a few chuckles managed to escape them, yet they remained professional and composed.\n\n"Da, Americansky. But you two must, er, how do you say... pay toll." Perhaps the news would be more bearable to Steve in English. No matter who the traveler is, no matter how noble their goals, no matter how interesting they are, we simply cannot uphold our quality of life without money. This strange and seemingly daring tourist was no exception.\n\n"I do not think we have the Zlatoust currency..." The young man seemed to embarrassingly stumble on his English, yet his companion, a hardened and clearly Russian woman traveling alongside him, offered the border guards some of the currency, barter goods, and a basic sweet talk to get the pair rolling along. While it certainly wasn't anywhere close to what our guards usually charge, they don't seem to harbor any malicious intent and they were allowed to past shortly after, seeking to get on a bus to the city of Zlatoust itself."

Upon hearing his name, the man waved at the Guards, who then exchanged looks.\n\nThe Guards eyed the strange pair warrily, sure the man posed no threat but the woman radiated deadly poise. Finally, one of the Guards spoke up, "are you refugees? We have plenty of warm food and-"\n\n"No," said the woman, "we're not refugees." A look of confusion passed between the sentinels and the second Guard replied.\n\n"Then what are you? Are you looking for employment? Mercenaries?"\n\nThe woman, Zoya, smiled, her lips twisting her wind-burnt face, "We're not refugees or mercenaries, comrades, we're tourists."\n\nThe Guards didn't know what to make of this, but waved the pair to follow them back towards Sibay.

I was told by Russians in other communities that the Southern Urals were a hellhole, but honestly, I can't see it. Everyone is so friendly, the food is good, and some of the Guards even know some English! Even Zoya is loosening up a little. She's been spending a lot of time with this Zaitsev guy, I think he used to be a sniper too. I've managed to find myself a friend too, his name is Pavel. Good guy, around my age, smokes a pack a day and has a surprisingly soft singing voice in spite of it.\n\nMe and him were talking the other night about the Southern Urals and I got to asking him why it had such a bad reputation. "Steve," he said to me in his broken, thickly accented English, "Ural League keeps people safe behind walls and with guns. Outside walls, there is cold, many bandit." I asked him how the other communities in the Urals managed and if he would recommend where I should go next and he said, "no place, get out of Ural. Orsk is bandit country run by King Rapist. Magnitogorsk even worse, crazy scientist in charge there, no one ever leave. Orenburg full of stupid, waste of time." I guess if the other territories are as bad as Pavel says, no wonder Sibay is a bunker-city! I should ask Zoya about it, she seems to know a little bit about everything."

After twenty-six hours of debate and an impassioned fist-fight, an agreement was reached. The council has concluded that using force to apprehend the fascist American spy and his Hitlerite goon would itself be a fascist action. Was not our commune founded on the principles of self-determination? We may hate him, but it is his right to be a fascist puppet of the American Reich and we cannot infringe upon it.

I was invited to a council meeting so that I, as an American Nazi-Tsarist-Bandit, might be 'enlightened by anarchism in action'. I don't really know what this was meant to accomplish because I've never seen anything so messy and dysfunctional! I know we Americans joke about the convoluted heap that is the NPP and Republican-Democratic Party, but our politics have nothing on Orenburg.\n\nThe meeting started out with the speaker, some little guy with glasses, being shouted down by half of the room, who I guess didn't like him very much. My Russian isn't great, but it isn't hard to figure out what 'fashisty' means. I have no idea what the meeting was even supposed to be about, and I'm pretty sure the council didn't either. At some point, fully three different speakers attempted to hold their speeches over one another, shouting louder and louder to be heard. I tried to say something to Zoya a couple times, but she never heard me over the noise. I won't even get started on the brawl that started in the middle of the room or the shoe that almost beaned me right in the head.\n\nWhen I was a little kid, my teacher used a talking stick to make sure only one person was speaking at a time so we wouldn't shout over each other. I'm sure Orenburg could really benefit from something like that, but I bet they would just decry a talking stick as an 'instrument of Hitlerite oppression'.

The sheer number of warlords out here is crazy, and in Western Siberia alone you can find every ideology under the sun. Nazis, commies, anarchists, and even liberals are out here, each with their own vision of how to save the Russian people. It's crazy to think that just thirty years ago (or so) this used to be one big country. For all the desolation and the ruins, there's a kind of beauty here that I didn't expect. I remember waking up one morning in Sibay and watching the rising sun stretch over the Urals. Never in my life have I wished I was an artist more. I wish you could see what I'm seeing, the good parts, I mean.\n\nI'm eating well, and my guide, Zoya, is keeping me safe. She used to be a partisan sniper back in the day so I'm never too worried when she's around. I think cousin Henry might like her, you know how he has a thing for strong ladies. She's been teaching me Russian and I think I'm really getting the hang of it. I have lots of questions for the locals and it feels awkward having Zoya do most of the translating, so I'm glad how well my lessons are going.\n\nHow are the neighbors? Did grandma's cough pass? Who won the Little League championship this year? Miss you, and I'll write again as soon as I can!\n\nP.S.

 RUS_tourist.63.t:0 "An Arrival from Orenburg"
 RUS_tourist.63.d:0 "A strange party recently entered the Republic's lands from the territory administered by Orenburg. The party, consisting of several Russians and an extensive baggage train was, remarkably, led by an American, and requested passage to Ufa.\n\nAlthough our frontier detachments were initially suspicious of their motives, prolonged questioning of the party, as well as close examination of their belongings, convinced them of the party's lack of hostile intent. Indeed, this American appears to be travelling across Russia, visiting as many states as possible and compiling a log of them, and this fact has not gone unnoticed by several members of our government.\n\nThey have raised the fact that international recognition of the Republic was and is critical to the maintenance of our sovereignty in the face of numerous regional and other threats. Therefore, increasing awareness of our Republic, our culture, and our challenges within America, and thus by extension the OFN, cannot but be beneficial.\n\nIt has been suggested that we chaperone the tourist and his entourage around Ufa, expose him to our cultural and religious practices, and allow him to see the regular devastation wrought by the German bombers. Surely if we do so he cannot but speak of the plight of our Republic, standing strong for our people in a time of great danger. And against great threats, besides.\n\nIf it will draw any attention at all, it will be worth it. We must only decide how insistent to be."

 RUS_tourist.64.t:0 "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.64.d:0 "Russia has been, for me and so far, a land of firsts. And Bashkiria, an officially Islamic state created by and for the Bashkir minority, is certainly that.\n\nCrossing from, and thankfully leaving behind, the chaos of Orenburg, we were allowed over the border with only several hours interrogation - very quickly by our standards so far. What's more, soon after we were approached by a small governmental delegation that offered to show us around. Zoya was wary about any 'minders,' but I saw an opportunity to gain access to experiences we might not have otherwise, in fear of offense. And that opportunity soon paid off.\n\nThe representative invited us to attend a service at Ufa's central mosque, as long as we were properly quiet and respectful, and though I have been a Christian all my life I must say it was most beautiful. The muezzin's call radiating from the mosque's minaret was oddly soothing, and the practiced ritual within, though far different from any church I have been in, possessed a serenity and sense of religious unity that I do not think I can accurately describe.\n\nLater, we toured the market where Zoya explained to me, as best she could, about the persecution these Bashkirs have traditionally faced. About how this state was their attempt to carve out a true homeland for themselves amid a war between parties that both despised them.\n\nBut, alas, it is time to move on, and so in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."
 RUS_tourist.64.a:0 "A homeland for one's people is a noble goal indeed."

 RUS_tourist.65.t:0 "Entry 24: The Islamic Republic of Bashkiria"
 RUS_tourist.65.d:0 "Over the last short while, I have grown to respect the Bashkir people tremendously. And I do not say such lightly.\n\nSo many of the states we have passed through have existed for no other reason than because some tyrant wanted them to. Because that tyrant wanted to control the lives of thousands or millions absolutely, and woe to those who crossed them. But here there is a national identity. A national culture. A national religion. All things that the Bashkirs fight for despite nearly everyone trying to take them away.\n\nToday, as we were touring the city's downtown, attending the Turkic monuments that still stood, we saw evidence of that. One of the ever-present German bombing raids shattered some buildings in Ufa, and we were nearby. Immediately we saw people, not just soldiers and police, but ordinary people from all places and classes rush forward to assist those trapped under the rubble. And, being close by, we could not but do the same ourselves.\n\nAs we helped, I could feel the spirit of community around me, a spirit, and feeling, that has been in very short supply in many of the places we have been so far. When I return home I hope that my journey to Bashkiria, together with what I have seen and felt while here, inspires others to keep this tiny nation in their thoughts and minds. It would be well-deserved by these people.\n\nBut, alas, our time here has necessarily come to an end, and in the morning we leave to cross the Belaya. There is apparently a 'Brotherhood' of sorts on the other side, and I cannot help but wonder if they will be at all similar to the ones in Oyrotia."

When the brothers moved to arrest him, he showed recognition of their uniforms, and began speaking German. They are therefore not sure what to make of the party.\n\nThe man claims to be American, journeying across Russia to observe the states and societies that occupy it, and though we know well how much corrupting subhuman influence exists in America, we cannot deny the basic possibility for Aryanism to exist there. If we were to welcome him, and showcase the superiority of our culture and race, of our purpose to bring strength and purity to the entire nation, it could do much for the Fyurer's cause.\n\nAt the same time, however, there is a party of Slavs with him, who in addition to possessing weapons do not seem as subservient as non-Aryans should be. He has additionally displayed some unease at the sight of the border guards' slave detachment. Some brothers have raised the concern that the entire construction of this 'American' could therefore be a trick, an attempt to insert a spy in our lands.\n\nA decision must be made. What do we do with this supposed 'Aryan?'"

It is so much worse, that in truth I have trouble finding the words to properly describe my horror.\n\nCrossing the Belaya from Ufa, we were nearly immediately set upon by brutish soldiers in German-looking uniforms, but once I began speaking to them in that language their demeanour shifted entirely, and a short while later we found ourselves escorted to their capital in Perm, or Permhaym as they call it. It was there that I discovered the monstrosity of a state we have found ourselves in.\n\nThe city is a nightmare, with vast processions of slaves shifted between worksites for forced labor. The slightest hesitation or defiance is met with brutal violence or summary execution, the choice of which seems to depend entirely on the whims of the specific oppressor. The 'brothers' call them subhumans and both themselves, and me, Aryan, which I have realized is the only reason we have not joined the unfortunates before us.\n\nIndeed, it has taken all my efforts to keep Zoya and the others together and under my supervision, and I do not know if I can do so much longer. I feel sick every time I speak to one of these monsters, and I fear it will not be long before they discover my true feelings.\n\nI have therefore spoken to Zoya, and she agrees that we must act before we are separated or our hosts change their opinion of me. Tonight we will wait for darkness and then make for the Kama, on the other side of which rests safety.\n\nI only hope we will make it. We should not have come."

And our brothers were vigilant enough to observe them. Vigilant enough to protect the purity of spirit, purity of form, and purity of essence that the Aryan embodies. Purity that this arrival clearly did not possess.\n\nFor what true Aryan would travel willingly with armed Slavs without careful overwatch? What true Aryan would treat them as his equals? What true Aryan would concern themselves with the 'plight' of the subhumans? No true Aryan, indeed.\n\nAnd so both he and they were therefore treated as any other suspect non-Aryans. Disarmed, placed in chains, and marched towards Permhaym. All except one - a Slav woman who attempted resistance, and found what was left of her dumped in the forest in response.\n\nThe brothers overseeing the factories around our capital have been informed of the imminent arrivals, and will soon find places where they can work to support their betters. In so doing, they can serve the purpose deserved to them.\n\nAnd if they show themselves unwilling to do so, well, the brothers are most skilled at applying proper discipline."

Elements of the Imperial Army, stationed nearby to keep watch on the territory of the fanatics in Perm, reported seeing a small party fleeing Brotherhood militias and attempting to cross the river.\n\nUpon observing that one of the party was carrying a large American flag, and additionally understanding the brutality of those living within Brotherhood territory, they moved to engage. As Brotherhood fighters began firing upon the party, itself struggling to cross the river, our forces engaged them, killing or wounding several before the fighters retreated.\n\nUpon rescue and interrogation, the leader of the party provided evidence identifying himself as an American and requested entry for himself and his companions into the Principality. He further explained that he was travelling across Russia on a journey of exploration, and that he was most grateful for their rescue from Brotherhood forces.\n\nFollowing confirmation that none of the American's companions were wanted by the Tsar's government, they were permitted entry and proceeded in the direction of Izhvesk.\n\nSecurity forces will maintain surveillance until their departure."

I also hope someone stamps them out for good. Zoya agrees.\n\nThis new nation we find ourselves in, Vyatka, seems much more stable than the last few. It's apparently ruled by a Tsar, who I thought was dead. At least that's what Mikhail told me, all the way back in Chita. Perhaps they're related? In any case we're here now, and not surrounded by black-clad murderers or literal slaves, so I'll give thanks regardless.\n\nWe've headed south, to the city of Izhvesk, which Zoya says she passed through years ago on her journey eastwards. It's certainly one of the more developed cities we've seen so far, with enormous industrial plants and factories producing equipment of all kinds. Even so, there seems to be a general malaise, as if everything has faded slightly. I'm not exactly sure how to properly describe it.\n\nThe one thing I have taken from this city, however, is a replacement for our horses now that we're in a part of Russia that actually has an extensive road network, as damaged as it may be. Using some of my remaining funds, I have purchased a reasonably new truck, which we shall use as we continue south-east, towards Tatarstan.\n\nIt should help accelerate this final leg of our journey considerably, and provide a better means of escape should we encounter future problems."

Consisting primarily of Russians, the one extraordinary exception is that of an American claiming to be on a journey across the whole of Russia, and this claim is supported by a dizzying array of artifacts originating from as far east as Petropavlovsk.\n\nAfter so proving their identity, they were allowed to proceed and departed, travelling in the direction of Kazan by way of Arsk in a Vyatkan-built truck. A truck that was observed to be flying a large American flag from its exhaust stack, and thus drawing the attention of many nearby.\n\nWe do not quite know what to make of this event. The party and its composition, especially the American with evidence of travel, is far too ostentatious and elaborate to be a reasonable attempt at cover from infiltrators from nearby states. However, when regarding the Tatar people, 'reasonable' has not historically been a word that can be applied to the Russians. We must be careful.\n\nThe party will not be harmed, lest there be an attempt being made to provoke the displeasure of the Americans or, by extension, the OFN. It will be allowed to proceed and interact, assuming the members of it do not attempt to break our laws.\n\nBut it will be watched. Carefully.

How wrong I was.\n\nThough they were not instantly hostile, the border guards looked long and hard at Zoya and the other Russians, and only seemed to relax - and display genuine interest besides - when they realized I was American, something I have grown to half-expect. As we began the journey to Kazan through the region's dense forests, this interest was displayed by nearly all that we passed, encouraged no doubt by my flag, which we have now attached to the exhaust stack and which waves proudly in the wind wherever we drive.\n\nExpecting to arrive at the city quite late, we together worried about finding accommodations, but this turned out not to be an issue, for as the city came into sight we were greeted with a sight both inspiring and terrifying. A German bomber raid had arrived over the city, and Kazan's air defense network, which Zoya had earlier told me was among the densest in Russia, and captured by the Tatars nearly wholescale when they seized the city, sprang into action.\n\nI cannot adequately describe the noises or colours that faced us over the next while, except as a thunderous kaleidoscope, with booming reds, reverberating yellows, and meteoric greens rising into the sky at small objects far overhead.\n\nBy the time the raid ended darkness had fallen, and so we decided to find an area to make camp, rather than risk entering a city on alert in the dead of night. In the morning, we will visit the city and then continue onwards to our next destination, heading south towards Samara. Even so, I do not think I will soon forget this experience.\n\nIndeed, I expect I will see it in my dreams."

 RUS_tourist.73.t:0 "In the Land of Treason"
 RUS_tourist.73.d:0 "As the Committee's border guards watched the truck approach that morning, they were not sure what to make of it. A Vyatkan truck, flying an American flag proudly from its exhaust stack, approaching from Tatarstan? Absurd, indeed.\n\nThey were only more confused when the window rolled down to reveal, among the Russians inside, an American. And their confusion reached its height when, in response to their interrogation, he told them he was travelling across the country. Inspecting his cargo and documents, which bore stamps from places as far away as Chita, Krasnoyarsk, and Sverdlovsk, they could not but believe him. And once a solicited bribe was paid, the way opened quickly.\n\nThe unpleasant experience at the border, however, foreshadowed nearly every subsequent encounter. Soldiers stared at them with suspicion and, often, barely-contained greed. People avoided them, having long learned that to involve oneself with the unusual was to court disaster. The American's companion, herself a former fighter against the Germans, seethed with, when out of sight of any soldiers, barely-contained rage.\n\nThe 'Vlasovites' were traitors, animals, little more than dogs, she said. There was no discovery to be had here, only hostility and depressing visages. Though she was usually content to allow the American to direct their course, here she offered advice - divert, and leave this blighted 'country' far behind.\n\nThe American pondered. He had long grown to trust the opinions and instincts of his compatriot, and yet the entire reason he had come to Russia was to observe the states and societies that comprised it.\n\nDid he divert course? Or did he tell her they were continuing?"

Not wanting them to investigate ourselves - and especially Zoya - any closer, we complied.\n\nThe lands and people we passed while heading southwards were as the sky itself was - gray, dreary, and decrepit, as if the life had been sucked out of them. The first major city we reached after passing through Simbirsk, Stavropol-na-Volga was, if it could be considered possible, even worse.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk grasped by some unseen malaise, but Stavropol seemed a city permanently braced for misery. The people looked at us with fear, and the demands for bribes only increased. Resources were scarce, with nearly everything appropriated by the military, and I was told that families hide their sons in attempts to avoid conscription. Indeed, it was so depressing that all I can remember, even now, is gray. Gray skies, gray roads, gray buildings, and gray food.\n\nZoya and the others expressed similar opinions, and so after a brief discussion, we decided to cut short our time in this horrible land. We will be making the next turn northwest, towards Gorky, reportedly the territory of an ex-Soviet tank brigade that has taken to raiding the German territories to the west for supplies.\n\nI confess to being slightly wary at the prospect, after our experiences in the Thief Territory, but these thoughts are tempered by the certainty that those lands must at least be better than the ones here."

In addition, the unit's commander has reported that the truck is prominently flying an American flag. Before committing the Brigade's forces to action, he has petitioned command for instructions. Central Staff is unsure of how to proceed.\n\nLaunching a full counterattack, in anticipation of the truck acting as a scout for a Committee-led raid, would consume considerable quantities of fuel, likely requiring an additional raid of the Reich's holdings to the west to replenish. However, sending a small party to meet the truck could leave said party vulnerable to ambush or capture. If we were to do so, the commander appointed would be critical, as they would have to act immediately based on the information at hand and their own personality.\n\nEither way, however, we must respond, and quickly. What command should be given?"

And what a sight it was.\n\nI had thought Izhevsk a grand example of industrial activity in Western Russia, but Gorky puts it to shame, with enormous factories turning out tank after tank, armoured car after armoured car. And unlike the ones we have seen otherwise on our travels, the Brigade actually decorates them with more than just a sigil.\n\nPassing through the city square, we saw a company of tanks pass through in formation, each painted iridescently in the image of a type of panther. The unit was, unsurprisingly, referred to as the 'Panther' company. I preferred the look of the lion 'model,' but Zoya preferred the look of the snow leopard, I assume from her previous time spent travelling across southern Siberia.\n\nAfter a short stay, during which I saw several members of the Brigade look longingly at our truck, we decided to again move on, this time heading north over the Volga towards Vologdan territory. Everyone says they are 'neutral,' and I am very curious to see what that word actually means in the chaos that is Russia."

The unit's commander, recently returned from a western raid, was apparently so stunned by this hesitation that he immediately ordered the parties within to be forcibly extracted and immediately shot.\n\nThis order was subsequently carried out, despite attempted resistance, and the bodies of the occupants were cremated soon after.\n\nFurthermore, the commander, taking note of a design quirk of the Vyatkan truck, had it moved to a local workshop where it was modified with armor plating, several light cannon off of disused armored vehicles, and significantly wider tires. He then personally drove it back to Gorky, with the American flag still flying from its exhaust stack.\n\nAlthough crude, the value of the vehicle was immediately seen. Armoured sufficiently to resist small arms fire from German settlers, but with sufficiently strong armament to defeat the same, along with significantly better fuel economy, carrying capacity, and navigatory ability, it is expected to perform well on raids into German territory.\n\nWhile the identity of the parties occupying it were not ascertained, the presence of the flag on the truck has led to the vehicle itself colloquially becoming known as 'an American.'\n\nConsequent demand has led to the retooling of a production line in Gorky in order to convert civilian trucks into 'Americans' for future use by the Brigade."

A Vyatkan truck, proudly flying an American flag, and carrying an actual American applied for entry to the Neutral State at a place of entry that rarely, if ever, saw either. Let alone both together.\n\nBereft of reason to deny entry, however, the guards eventually allowed passage, after considerable interrogation, of course. As the truck crossed the river and turned onto the main roadway towards Vologda proper, its passengers were most perplexed.\n\nThey had been to so many places where the people were fearful of outsiders, careful to hide themselves away until safety was assured. But here it was very different. Here people peered at and waved to the truck as it passed by, curious about and interested in both the flag and the people who drove under it. And, on one of the vanishingly few occasions to do so that had been made apparent so far, the passengers waved back.\n\nIndeed, as they drew closer they got to the city, and as the habitation became more dense, so too did the amount and degree of attention increase, to the great delight of one of the passengers. By the time the truck reached Vologda, the group riding in it were thoroughly energized, ready to explore a state that had so apparently warmly accepted them.\n\nSuch was quite a rarity in Russia indeed, and the passengers intended to make the most of it."

While this should be the natural order of things, it is, as I am distressed to have personally experienced, quite an oddity in Russia. Truly an enviable city, indeed.\n\nIt is, however, no Omsk. While the people here are certainly peaceful, and committed to their ideals of armed neutrality, they do not have the drive, the passion, the total commitment to that peace that I observed in that great city. There I remember being struck by the wild-eyed passion for peace, for the drive towards the final victory of it, and for the absolute certainty possessed by so many, especially the officials, that they would achieve such, They knew that there would be challenges, or 'Trials' as they had seemingly taken to calling them, but they were not afraid, and some even looked forward to them.\n\nNo, Vologda is no Omsk, but it is close as I think I have yet found, and that must be enough. Regardless, we must move on. Zoya is directing us northeast, towards an apparently fractious democratic republic, and I am cautiously optimistic that it may display some of the fundamentally beneficial and stabilizing qualities we have seen in the depressingly few democracies we have so far encountered.\n\nIf not, I am sure it will at least be interesting to observe."

It was much better than Syktyvkar at the very least. But every now and then, oddities would crop up from the Neutral State.\n\nOne such oddity arrived early that morning in Veliky Ustyug, when a truck bearing an American flag pulled up at a local checkpoint. When questioned, the driver was discovered to be an American himself, having come a long way from the east all the way here to Komi on a tour through Russia.\n\nPerplexed, the guards immediately began debating with each other on what to do. Their own political biases quickly arose, with accusations being thrown around of him being a CIA agent, or a hired spy from Moskowien, or even an infiltrator from the Revolutionary Front, as absurd as it sounded. It was rare to see such a foreign face, and with political divisions at an all time high in the republic, so were suspicions. Ultimately though, it was up to their commander.\n\nAfter some deliberation, the guards were ordered to let the truck pass. Reluctantly they waved the American and his entourage through the checkpoint, and into the most unstable democracy in Russia.

Entering the city, I quickly heard news about a session of the 'National Assembly', a government body not too dissimilar to Congress, occurring later that day. This, of course, was something I simply couldn't miss.\n\nIn short, it was chaotic. And yet it wasn't the anarchic mess that was Orenburg's council meeting; there was an order to it, in a weird way. The moment the president finished his opening speech, everyone was out shouting for their own agenda; and lord, were there a lot of agendas. I'll be frank when I say this; Komi is probably the most politically diverse nation I have ever seen in my life. Deputies of all stripes and beliefs debated long through the hours. Communists, monarchists, socialists and conservatives and liberals and so many others struggled to force their agenda through a myriad of bills and proposals and amendments.\n\nIn a strange way, it was... exhilarating? I never thought I'd be so invested into a bunch of old men and women bickering over tax rates, but there I was. It was like a movie, and the cast was the most colorful I've seen; there was a Ms. Stalina standing firm against the extremists, there was Mr. Gumilyov and Zhdanov, both boisterous and jovial, Mr. Taboritsky, who reminded me way too much of my Uncle Elmer, the creep, then there was the president and vice president. They both looked absolutely miserable.\n\nAnother figure of note wasn't actually in the assembly chamber, they were sitting right next to me in the gallery. Even at the most heated points in the assembly debate, this man never jeered or shouted or, well, showed much emotion at all, really. At the end of the session, he offered a handshake and we exchanged names. Something Suslov, I think he was. Nice fellow, but quite odd.\n\nKomi was a bizarre yet fascinating place. In a strange way, I wish I could've stayed a little while longer. But my journey continues north."

 RUS_tourist.83.d:0 "Komi is best described as a "Place for Everyone". Even the criminals, it seems.\n\nThe Kuratov District of Syktyvkar is essentially a huge racket. Many of the locals here resort to radical leftism amidst the "failures of the Voronetsky government" as they say. Regular Luftwaffe bombings destroy morale, infastructure, and livelihoods, and it seems sometimes to the people of Komi that this radicalism will solve their problems. Among these problems, crime is a bit too high around these parts. As Zoya and I walked into the district, we were immediately almost pickpocketed by a group of children. A small gunfight between fascist partisans and communists barely drove them away. Zoya dragged me into an alleyway, where we stayed for a few minutes until the action died down. Of course, like sharks to blood, it seems desperate schemers can claw their way into "helping" the desperate.\n\nWhen I was trying to interview the average citizens of Syktyvkar, a socialist paramilitary group walked into the apartment building. Of course, seeing outsiders, they were more than happy to accost us.\n\n"Hey, look at this poor Yankee!" Some of them yelled. "You look like you've had a rough time in the Kuratov District, Tovarish. Why not pay us for some protection?"\n\nZoya was very apprehensive as was I, yet we had no chance to defend ourselves against armed and opportunistic partisans. After we failed to talk our way out of this situation, we were essentially forced to pay up as they "escorted" us around the district. As such, it was rather hard to interview non-socialists as we had guns and knives to our back, encouraging us to talk to more... favorable citizens. Nevertheless, they left us at the end of the day, and we quickly fled the District."

While looking for a place to spend the night, I ran into a radio host of Radio Free Syktyvkar, a man called Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov. Zoya and I have heard his voice and other broadcasts from RFS throughout our trek through Western Russia. Ivan was a short and stout but lively middle-aged man. We bumped into each other by accident while he was out shopping for vodka, of which I caught a falling bottle of his. While that in itself was an icebreaker, I told him a bit about my story and mission, of which Ivan excitedly invited me to star with him live on the air the following night. Zoya and I graciously accepted.\n\nAlthough the studio was small and certainly dated, Ivan's liveliness and the chemistry that we had together on the air was something I will always be able to visualize. It started off simple enough; a basic introduction, followed by my backstory, and finally how I came to Russia. Zoya decided to stay out of it, but she sat in the room with us to translate. After reading and discussing some diary entries for what felt like hours, we ended the show at the crack of dawn. Ivan wished us well, and I promised to write back to him when I return home. He was kind enough to leave an excerpt from the show, of which I will copy here.\n\n"So, Steve Smith. The legendary American from across the sea... Do you have anything to say to Komi? To Russia?"\n\n"Well, Ivan, truth be told, nothing can tell my story better than the heart can. Every word in this diary right here has come from it, and the stories of the wonderful people of Russia will never be forgotten. Despite the Union no longer existing, Russia is certainly far from lost, and the spirit of her people will never be erased. I promise that her stories will live on in this book.

It couldn't be, but Dezhnyov was sure of it. There was only one nation with a flag like that.

I was just getting attached to that thing too. At least their superiors were nice enough to give us some kind of compensation, giving us a few horses to carry our belongings for the rest of our journey, although we can't bring them into Onega. Clearly the Grand Marshal doesn't want us wandering off without supervision, and they've assigned a small convoy to escort us to Arkhangelsk where we will stay the night before immediately exiting the Front's territory. I would argue about the poor hospitality, but they've at least not attempted to shoot us yet.\n\nRegardless of how I feel about the loss of our truck, the Grand Marshal has guaranteed our safe transfer across the Onegan border, and the end of my journey is in sight.

Well, American carpet that covered the short jet bridge separating him from home, from his family. For all the bravery and guts that carried him through wartorn Russia, the homesickness he had pushed away as long as possible finally came pouring through the floodgates in the form of bittersweet tears as he neared the gate.\n\nEmerging into the airport, he immediately spotted his family waiting with grinning faces and minds abuzz with questions. Wordlessly, Steve embraced every family member who had come to meet him there. His mother teared up with joy that her son had made it home in one piece, which shouldn't have been a surprise considering he'd called her in Scotland. His father patted him on the back as they embraced, whispering heartfelt affirmations of his pride. Even a few cousins and his uncle were there, as well as a mass of people he didn't know. Surely, they'd been attracted to tales of his exploits, and Steve assured them wearily that their questions would be answered soon as he walked to his father's truck, stumbled into the backseat, and fell asleep before the car had even started."

 RUS_tourist.94.t:0 "A Quiet Realization"
 RUS_tourist.94.d:0 "After so many months of hard camping, often in the pitch-black wilderness and under the starry Russian sky, Steve Smith's family home felt almost alien.\n\nThe sky was different. The air was different. The people were different. And, more than anything else, the feeling was different. In Russia, as he had learned many times to his peril, danger was ever present, and the safety that he knew here, whenever it could be found, was inevitably fleeting.\n\nHe realized, with both a start and a sudden rush of guilt, that it wasn't fair. People had greeted him when he had returned. They had called him a brave explorer. The papers had done a couple small stories on him. In his hometown, he was now something of a celebrity.\n\nBut what about Zoya? About the others? The ones who had risked just as much as him, every step of the way, in their shattered and war-torn country? Where was their story, their celebrity? It was nowhere, Steve knew, and that he could not allow.\n\nDigging through his bags, he collected the voluminous journals he had filled out, the stacks of photographs he had taken, and the trinkets that he had kept that day at the Finnish border. He also collected his father's old typewriter. Arranging them all on his desk, he sat down and withdrew a stack of paper.\n\nHe could tell their story. He could recount the journey they had all taken together. He did not know how long it would take to write, edit, and publish, but he did know he would not rest until it was done.\n\nHe owed them that much."

 RUS_tourist.95.t:0 "'Across the Tundra' Becomes Bestseller!"
 RUS_tourist.95.d:0 "The publication of a travelogue by American Steven Smith has drawn considerable interest both domestically as well as worldwide, with demand outpacing supply by a wide margin. Smith's book, 'Across the Tundra,' consists of a curated collection of journal writings, narrations, and photographs of the people, experiences, and locations encountered during his long journey across the entirety of Russia, from the Far East to Finland.\n\nProviding what more than one reviewer has called 'a fascinating window' into the tumultuous political situation of modern Russia, its publication has resulted in considerable public interest regarding humanitarian conditions and efforts within many of the less-fortunate Russian successor states, with officials in multiple countries calling for more attention to be dedicated to the provisions of such humanitarian aid."

 RUS_tourist.96.t:0 "They Shall Not Grow Old"
 RUS_tourist.96.d:0 "Martha Smith had been counting the days since her son had gone off to Russia, that land so wild and untamed, brimming with its slobbering tyrants and bloodthirsty bandits. She had not heard a word from him in months since his last letter. Even as the great land was being brought to heel by a half dozen or so such tyrants now left, their states establishing bonds with the land of the free, she still didn't get so much as a word of news on the state of her boy. Now, as she marked off another tally in the secret journal under her bed that she was sure Earnest didn't know about, she placed her head in her hands and began her tearless sobbing. She had simply run out by the first month after she began this nightly routine.\n\nGulping down the glass of water on her nightstand, she slid the journal back under the bed. Earnest was working late, or so she had been told, and so she had dedicated the hours between his call from work at 7:00 to his return home to her grief. Her suffering is cyclical as she awaits closure that simply never will come.\n\nEarnest was not working late. Clearing trash off the dashboard of his old beat up truck, he searched for the letter he had recovered last time he was 'working late', scouring the old main for any kind of news from Russia about his son. He had found only one scrap of closure after endless nights searching for something to placate his suffering wife, a communique from a Russian citizen from a city called Harbin writing to an American cousin of his about how he had seen an American pass through. That was it. Apart from the few letters he had gotten, this was all that was left of his son in paper. The famously stoic, hardworking man cast the letter aside as it was stained with tears, and laid his head on the steering wheel to cry."
