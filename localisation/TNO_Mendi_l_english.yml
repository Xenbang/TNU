 POLITICS_DAVID_LANSANA_DESC:0 "When the world trembled under the German panzers and the Japanese battleships, old overlords fell, and new hopeful nations rose in their place, free from the chains that used to bind them. One such nation was the Republic of Sierra Leone, once merely one of the many African colonies of the British Empire, now a fledgling democracy - one that wasn't destined to last. Merely four days after the republic was proclaimed and a democratically elected government was held, the armed forces forcefully seized the capital, led by none other than Brigadier David Lansana.\n\nBorn in 1922 from a prominent Mende family, Lansana was one of the few in Sierra Leone who was selected to undergo military training as an officer in the United Kingdom. Upon returning to his homeland, he married the daughter of a Mende paramount chief - furthering his already extensive network of political connections. When the British hastily retreated from Africa, Lansana became the leader of the Sierra Leonean armed forces. Despite his proclaimed commitment to Sierra Leonean democracy, Lansana had no qualms about couping the government when a party opposed to his clique won in the country's first elections - and now, he stands as the leader of the new, Mendi state that replaced the Republic.\n\nFrom the outset, Lansana's regime was unstable, marred by strong inter ethnic conflicts (which was only exacerbated by the new wave of Mendi nationalism and suprematism), and by the rising power of generals and local warlords formally allied to Lansana, such as general Andrew Juxon-Smith. With Lansana's hold on power growing more and more shaky, and the Mendi economy struggling to pick up speed, it seems like the only reason the general wasn't ousted from power and his tinpot regime removed is that the opposition to his rule isn't unified in a common front - at least for now.
