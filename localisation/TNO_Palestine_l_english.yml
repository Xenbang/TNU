 POLITICS_Yasser_Arafat_DESC:0 "In just a few decades, a man rose from obscurity to fame, becoming the face of the new Palestine - his name is Yasser Arafat. Born in Egypt to a humble Palestinian family, the young Arafat would soon become a protagonist of Arab political life in the Italian Levant and far beyond. Rising to the forefront of the struggle for independence and freedom in Palestine, Arafat was among the founders of Fatah - an organization born out of an uneasy compromise between the militant Palestinian youth campaigning for democracy, and the Italian authorities, ever wary of those who dare defy them.\n\nAs Fatah grew rapidly, it found an unlikely ally in the emir of Transjordan, Hussein. At the same time, Arafat asserted himself as the leader of the movement, soon becoming the main interlocutor for Italy in the Arab camp, as one of the few prominent leaders willing to negotiate with Italy and a useful counter to the much more radical Arab organizations that had become a thorn in the Italians' side. After the victorious war against Turkey, the complex process of decolonization ended with the breakup of the Italian Levant - and at long last, independence for Republic of Palestine, with Arafat being declared as its leader.\n\nWhile this success strengthened Arafat's position and popularity among the Arabs, the threats to him and to Palestinian democracy are still many. First, the Arab radicals of both left and right, still furious at the existence of an Israeli state, openly declared Fatah to have betrayed the cause of Arab nationalism; and within Palestine, the supporters of former emir Hussein have grown to hate Fatah and its reformist policies. Arafat might have won his battle, but he is far from winning his war - and now more than ever, the hopes for peace in the Levant rest on the shoulders of a single man."
