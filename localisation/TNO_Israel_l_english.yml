 #Leader Bios
 POLITICS_Yitzhak_Rabin_DESC:0 "To state that Yitzhak Rabin is a popular figure would be an understatement. The father of the nation, the leader of Haganah, and the great compromiser. The man who brought peace to the Middle East at last, and ensured that Israel would fight no war with the Arabs. However, Rabin is by no means a willing compromiser, and was once the hawk of Haganah. Born a sabra in Jerusalem to an American and a Belarusian, Rabin was raised a Labour Zionist, to fight for socialism and the land of Israel. So, at age 14, young Rabin joined his mother's agricultural school near Petah Tikva.\n\nAt this time, he was also inducted into a not-so-little paramilitary responsible for defending Ha-Yishuv against the British and the Arabs: Haganah. It was here, as a defender of the settlements, that Rabin began his long-lasting military career. During the 50s, as the leadership of Haganah aged or went to fight for other goals of Judaism and Socialism the world over, young Rabin found himself in charge of the primary Zionist militia in the Middle East. However, much had changed since his early days. Now, the British were gone, and a new European power ruled over the Levant: Italy.\n\nDespite Rabin's primary position as a militarist and warrior, he saw the need for reconciliation and compromise with not just his fellow Jews, but the Arabs and the Italians as well. So, he began negotiations with dalla Chiesa and fellow socialist, Yasser Arafat - leader of Fatah. After much debate and compromise, the lands of Israel and Palestine reached a peaceful settlement, and Italian colonialism was brought down at last. However, with Rabin now having little stand in his way as Prime Minister of Israel, one wonders if he shall hold to peace, or if his past as a warrior shall come back to haunt the Levant."
 POLITICS_AVRAHAM_STERN_DESC:0 "To say that Avraham Stern is a brutal man would be a severe understatement. To say that Avraham Stern is a dictator would again be an understatement. And to say Avraham Stern has dedicated his life to the idea of a Jewish State would be the greatest understatement of all. Born in Russia in 1907, Stern emigrated to British Occupied Palestine at the age of 18 in 1925. Quickly becoming involved with the Haganah in 1929, Stern radicalized rapidly, and soon began to argue for a Jewish State encompassing the Levant. He left Haganah for the Irgun - and when the Second World War broke out, he left Irgun to strike out for his own beliefs - The Fighters for the Freedom of Israel. Lehi.\n\nStern grew to believe in a chosen people - but not as the Germans saw it. No, the true masters of the world were the Children of Israel, the Jews. During the war, Stern offered to join the war on the side of the Germans and Italians - and when no help came, he resolved to fight for Israel himself. His dream of an authoritarian, German-inspired Israel did not come to pass - but he and his unknown soldiers would not end their fight.\n\nFor twenty years, Stern and Lehi have fought, bled, and died for their dream, their lives spent surrounded by terror, and the shadow of death. Hundreds of men, women, and children have died cruel, brutal deaths in their war, but it mattered not, for now their dream has become a reality.\n\nTo say the future of the many ethnicities and religions of the Levant is dark is the worst understatement of all, for above the towns and cities of Israel, above Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem, banners have been raised, and on them is written "Defense and Conquest.""
 POLITICS_Menachem_Begin_DESC:0 "Twenty years ago, the thought of a Jewish Homeland was for many an impossible dream, a childish fantasy quashed by the Nazi Jackboot - and yet Zion has been found, spanning the banks of the Mediterranean past the banks of the River Jordan, independent from British, German, or Italian Rule, all thanks to one man. Menachem Begin was born in Brest in the summer of 1913, and since childhood has fought for a home. Joining the Betar Revisionist Zionist group, Begin was for a brief time imprisoned by the NKVD before being sent to Palestine in 1942. A pupil of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the father of Revisionist Zionism, it was only natural that Begin would join his paramilitary group, the Irgun. Fiercely against cooperation with the British, Begin, with the aid of the extreme Revisionist group Lehi launched an armed rebellion, which, combined with Italian and German invasion, forced the occupiers out of Palestine.\n\nBegin's dreams of a free Israel were shattered as the Italians instituted their military governorate, and Irgun resolved itself to resist the fascists as they had resisted the British.\n\nFor years, they have fought and bled for freedom, even assassinating the original governor-general, Rodolfo Graziani, among many other colonial occupiers - and now the time has finally come. His critics decry him as an authoritarian, an anti-democratic brute, but only Begin alone knows his plans for the Levant. A new day for Eretz Yisrael has dawned, and Menachem Begin will be the one to lead the Jewish People to their future."
 POLITICS_YISRAEL_GALILI_DESC:0 "Yisrael Galili was in many ways a shadow in Haganah  - often invisible, always present. Born in a remote Ukrainian hamlet in 1911 and emigrating to Tel Aviv as a small child, young Yisrael lived up to his name, joining the Zionist movement. A founding member of HaNoar HaOved, the Labour Zionist youth, Galili quickly enlisted into Haganah, taking up arms against the British. A man of many talents, he not only proved to be a skillful soldier, but also a charismatic leader and politician, rising through the ranks of the organization just as times were about to change in the Levant, and the world.\n\nThe Mediterranean had a new master, the Roman eagle spreading its wings over the sea's shores - and underneath its shadow, the Levantine Jews faced an uncertain destiny. Despite falling out with its Nazi ally, Italy still had a fluctuating relationship with the Jews, promising them nationhood and protection at one point only to deny it a few moments later. While others in Haganah promoted a conciliatory, "wait and see" attitude towards the Italians, Galili fiercely and consistently demanded that the Jews take up arms to clip the empire's wings\n\nConversely, as tensions between Haganah and its rival Irgun rose, Galili argued for a united Jewish front - which finally materialized during the surge of Harakiyyin activity in the Levant. The Italians had no choice but to beg for Jewish arms to keep the region from falling to the communists. Thus Galili and his allies, the closest of them (perhaps a bit too close, according to some rumours) being veteran politician Golda Meir, now face the daunting task of building not only a Jewish homeland, but also a lasting peace in the Levant. Whether they will succeed, perhaps only the ancient wind that whispers secrets over the Holy Land knows."
