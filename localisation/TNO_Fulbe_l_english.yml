 POLITICS_MURTALA_MOHAMMED_DESC:0 "Murtala Muhammed is a soldier of Islam, through and through. He has been a soldier since his birth, and will most likely be one until he dies.\n\nBorn to a conservative, religious, and important Fulani family only a year before the Second World War shattered the world order, Muhammed was trained to defend his people from the increasingly aggressive Cameroonian revolutionaries. Throughout his formative years, Muhammed was steeped in fundamentalist Islamic thought, most notably the tradition of Fiqh, or Islamic jurisprudence. When the revolutionary attacks finally grew to be to much, the Fulani moved to what was once Niger, where they were as far from the revolutionaries as they could be. There, Murtala's fundamentalist ideas and policies began to draw the attention and support of his peers. This culminated in the Fulani Insurrection, in which Murtala led his supporters and solidified his control over the local area.\n\nToday, Murtala's eyes and ears are angled inwards, as he simultaneously tries to fix a shattered nations economy while building, strengthening, and solidifying his own cult of personality. However, his hopes and dreams look outwards into West Africa, where Murtala holds dreams of restoring the Fulani people's long-lost glory and power. Whether these hopes will ever be established depends on how well Murtala can fix his nation and his support, as without either of these behind him, he and the Fulani will certainly be doomed to irrelevance."
