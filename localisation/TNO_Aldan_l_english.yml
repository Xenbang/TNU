 ### Leader Bio ###
 POLITICS_GURZHAP_OCHIROV_DESC:0 "Gurzhap Vanyushkeevich Ochirov was born in the waning days of the Russian Empire to a Buryat family in the frigid Transbaikal region. Drafted into the Red Army, he rose through the ranks of the Buryat Cavalry Division and made a name for himself in the intelligence corps. Initially fighting against the Japanese in battles such as Khalkhin Gol, Captain Ochirov was transferred to the European Front when Operation Barbarossa happened. But only a month into the war, he was wounded and stranded behind enemy lines. His salvation came in the form of partisan leader Nikifor "Batya" Kolyada, and Ochirov soon became his loyal lieutenant. Together, they led a guerrilla war against the Germans and killed thousands of invaders, managing to slip past enemy lines after three years of brutal fighting.\n\nKolyada and Ochirov returned to a homeland in chaos. Bukharin had been removed from power, and all semblance of stability was rapidly eroding. The partisans helped as many civilians flee east with them as they could, and their trek ended in Yagoda's provisional Soviet government in Irkutsk. Yagoda sought to use them to reinforce his peripheries, having them garrison the town of Aldan. But as the years passed, Yagoda's tyranny wore down both the partisans and the civilians, and they eventually picked up their rifles and fought for freedom once more.\n\nThe partisans were able to free Aldan from beneath Irkutsk's boot, but not without a steep cost. Kolyada was killed in the fighting, and de facto command of both the military and the city fell to Ochirov. He has done a good job of maintaining stability and rule of law, but has amounted to little else since then. He is a soldier without a cause, leading an army of partisans far from home, in a city-state surrounded by enemies. With no purpose driving him or his men, all that is left for them to do is simply survive."
