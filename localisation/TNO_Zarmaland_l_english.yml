 POLITICS_SEYNI_KOUNTCHE_DESC:0 "The Zarma people were once simply men surviving under the boot of the French, their nobles doing everything to survive their advances, making deals, avoiding trouble. But now, they are under a leader with the will and the way to lead the Zarma to freedom. Seyni Kountché is that man, a man with history connected to the Zarma, who brings the people of Zarmaland the strength to face down those who are enemies to the Zarma, like Issa Korombé and his struggle against the Fulani. However, that's but a façade. Seyni Kountché was but a man in the right place at the right time. Born the heir to the Zarmakoy Tondikandie, the heavily stratified Zarma society always held Kountché and his family in high regard, and the young man entered into training in the West African branch of the French army quite early. He slowly rose through the ranks in the Free French army after the mainland fell.\n\n\n\nThen the bombs started falling.

He took his opportunity quickly, leveraging his place as the nobility to rile the Zarma underneath him, establishing it as his domain in West Africa as the Luftwaffe destroyed all around them. This land, however, happened to be within the borders of the Sultanate of Sokoto, but what could they do about it? Hell was raining from the skies, there was no way to prevent this man from calling this land his own. One day, however, the bombings stopped. The Sokoto were weak, and more importantly, many of their army were Zarma. A speech here and there,, and allies flocked to their side. Months after the bombing stopped, Kountché declared an independent Zarma state from Sokoto. But Kountché's control appears to be coming to an end. The people hate him and his deputies hate him even more. It seems that Kountché needs to make some difficult choices to remain in power..."
