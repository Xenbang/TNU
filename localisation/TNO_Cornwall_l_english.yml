POLITICS_FRANZ_HALDER_DESC:0 "The Sword of Damocles is held above England's throat, not by the finest thread, but by the aged, gnarled hands of Franz Halder. Generaloberst Halder has grown old in service to the Greater German Reich, his commission has taken him to Poland, Denmark, Norway, France and into the desolate frozen depths of Russia. After years of touring the world courtesy of the Wehrmacht, Halder has settled in England as Protector of the West. At a single word from him, the Island will burn again as the Cornish Garrison strikes.\n\nGeneraloberst Halder's plans led the Wehrmacht successfully through Poland and he personally commanded the strike against Moscow that left the Russian capital in flames. As a general, Halder is regarded as one of Germany's best, a name to stand proud against such names as 'Manstein', 'Model' or 'Rommel'.\n\nCompared to the frozen hell of Russia or the searing savannahs of Africa, Cornwalll is one of the most desirable postings in the Reich. The preference for sons of officers and party officials; The wealthy and connected. This provides Cornwalll with a steady stream of vital reinforcements and the best matériel to arm its soldiers with. Halder and the Garrison's reward for their diligent service is to be free from the madness that threatens to engulf Germany, in one of the Reich's safer postings. Halder knows however, that no matter how well manned or supplied his post is, they are a small island in a storm tossed sea. The Cornish garrison can only survive with the assistance of the Reich, but that is the one thing they can rely on, right?"

 CRN_garrison_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison stands as the pride of Germany's foreign fighting forces. While many of the garrisons of the various Reichskommissariats throughout Europe are poorly equipped and badly trained, just barely holding on, Generaloberst Franz Halder's men are well trained veterans, rivaling even those Wehrmacht soldiers serving in Germany proper."
 CRN_Extreme_Overextension_desc:0 "Though officially residing within English territory, the Cornwall Garrison has been given a substantial amount of land to watch over. So substantial, in fact, that the Garrison has had difficulty holding on to and patrolling the territory. This has displeased the Garrison's minders in Germania, who have cut funding until the situation improves. This displeasure has further filtered down to the men themselves, leading to some loss of morale among the soldiers."
 CRN_No_Gov_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison resides in a strange position within the Einheitspakt. Unlike other German controlled territories, the Garrison's ultimate purpose is not Germanization and eventual integration into the Reich, but simply to keep the English under wraps. Thus, Cornwall has not been given the bureaucratic structures it needs to exist as a proper nation, relying on Germany for most matters of military production and reinforcement."
