 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_BOBODZHAN_GAFUROV_DESC:0 "Few men are as loyal and devoted to socialism as much as Bobodzhan Gafurov. Gafurov is well-known as a hardliner, faithful to communism ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, and is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan. Initially a historian, he quickly climbed the ranks of the Party to become its leader. While the country may have seceded from the Soviet Union as it was falling under the German jackboot, he still holds out for another communist power to resurge and take back control.\n\nEven as the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the Kazakh Red Army collapsed in the West Russian War and its aftermath, Gafurov kept his loyalty and still maintains close ties with the neighboring Kyzylorda. Even though he knows he is not the best to lead his nation through these turbulent times, seeing as he is not an expert in politics, he still has declined to give away his power to anyone. This is not due to his autocratic tendencies, but his ideology and beliefs: Gafurov has not found anyone he has deemed worthy of bearing the torch of socialism in the country, and so has kept control.\n\nStill, day by day; the General Secretary's control is slowly slipping away. The members of the Politburo, the small governing body of the nation, begin to lose loyalty to their leader. Meanwhile, dissidents opposed to the government prepare to take matters into their own hands and bring down the system which has so clearly failed. Gafurov's reign might soon be coming to an end."
