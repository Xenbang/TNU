  CHL_idea_crippled_sovereignty: "Crippled Sovereignty"
  CHL_idea_crippled_sovereignty_desc: "For almost a century Chile has not had a complete say in its internal affairs, due to the crippling influence of foreign factors and influence which were allowed to become a driving force in socioeconomic and also political matters. This great-power competition within our borders was already a cause of a civil war in Chile in the past.\n\nAt this moment, Chilean sovereignty is once again threatened by the presence of dueling economic interests, as the Americans and Japanese fight for influence in all areas of Chilean social, economic, and political life."

  CHL_idea_ethnic_tension_1: "Ethnic Tensions"
  CHL_idea_ethnic_tension_1_desc: "The South of Chile is a demographic oddity as places go in the world. This began due to a process of cultural and economic exchange between the local Mapuche and Spanish settlers, then followed by a colonization effort drawing on other settlers from throughout Europe, and concluding with the forced subjugation of the Mapuche through a quick brutal war.\n\nDue to instability and anger caused by a combination of racial tensions and stresses caused by the Hacienda system, the whole region is turning into a powder-keg that might explode at any moment."

  CHL_idea_la_hacienda_1: "La Hacienda"
  CHL_idea_la_hacienda_1_desc: "One of Chile's main defining features is its rurality: more than half of our population is tied to the land or region in which it was born.\n\nThis originates in the Colonial Era; the constant state of warfare that Chile then faced turned it into one large military fortress without any economic concern. The commanders of the military in that area made use of the semi-feudal hacienda system to sustain their power in the region; this was ideal for recruitment and the mobilization of armies, but not as ideal for promoting economic growth and national prosperity.\n\nThe consequences of this system to this day are immense; landlords control large amounts of territory that they cannot hope to manage efficiently in a hundred years. As such, a large portion of our peasant class is tied to a remnant of the feudal age persisting to this day."

  CHL_idea_FDC_liberal_dominance: "FDC - Liberals Dominant"
  CHL_idea_FDC_liberal_dominance_desc: "The Frente Democrático de Chile, or FDC for short, is the political hegemon of Chile and has served as the sole driving force of this country for the past twenty years. It was born out of the Crisis of 1946 that destroyed the Radical Party and resulted in a union of convenience between Liberals and Conservatives. This political union has become a fire-forged friendship through the challenges the FDC faced during its reign.\n\nAt this moment, while the Coalition is still united in purpose, it's quickly showing cracks in its foundations as disagreements begin to mount and splits on doctrinal lines appear once again. However, this time the division is between the dominant §wLiberals§! under Hugo Zepeda and the rising §VTechnocrats§! under Julio Philippi.\n\nCurrently, President Alessandri seems to be favoring the Liberal faction, working with them along with a few conservatives to get the day-to-day business of running Chile done."
  CHL_idea_FDC_moderate_dominance: "FDC - Moderate"
  CHL_idea_FDC_moderate_dominance_desc: "The Frente Democrático de Chile, or FDC for short, is the political hegemon of Chile and has served as the sole driving force of this country for the past twenty years. It was born out of the Crisis of 1946 that destroyed the Radical Party and resulted in a union of convenience between Liberals and Conservatives.

  CHL_idea_FDC_technocrat_dominance: "FDC - Technocrats Dominant"

  CHL_idea_DC: "The DC"
  CHL_idea_DC_desc: "The Partido Demócrata Cristiano has its roots in discontented Christians exiting the Conservative Party in 1938 to form a group called the Falange Nacional. Contrary to the Spanish Falange, this Falange was a group of centrists, following the way of Christian moral ethics. This gave them an interesting moral impetus, to support leftists when needed, and to support rightists when needed. The PDC formed by merging with other parties in 1958 to support the presidential candidacy of their long-time leader, Eduardo Frei Montalva.\n\nThe PDC attracts an interesting coalition of support from both the right and the left, the strong Christian social values attracting the right, and the progressive economic reform attracting the left. Now that Frei is in La Moneda, maintaining this coalition of support is all-important."

  CHL_idea_FRAP: "The FRAP"
  CHL_idea_FRAP_desc: "Electorally, socialists and communists are like oil and water. Yet defying all rules of chemistry triumphantly stands the Frente de Acción Popular, having finally secured a left-wing Chilean government. The product of Salvador Allende's political ministrations, the front began as an alliance between his Partido Socialista and the Partido Comunista de Chile before incorporating the maundering Partido Radical. Miraculously, this union has enjoyed a decade of life, twice fielding Allende as a presidential candidate before his 1964 victory. Whether it will survive government, however, is yet to be seen. The FRAP must eventually answer its existential question, for it hangs over it like the Sword of Damocles: what is the coalition, a Worker's Front, or one of National Liberation?"

  CHL_idea_UNAPO: "The UNAPO"
  CHL_idea_UNAPO_desc: "Progressives, conservatives and fascists marching side-by-side; it's not in time, but the beat of government is the same. The Unión Nacional Popular is a massive coalition of parties right of the Socialists. Its patchwork machinery is tentatively glued together by shared nationalism and the maneuverings of Jorge Prat Echaurren, its stalwartly corporatist leader. Its origins lie in the union of the populist Partido Agrario Laborista - ardent followers of the nebulous ideology of former dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campos - Prat's Conservatives and anti-communist Partido Radical members, with hardline Falangists added soon after. Where Alessandri equivocated on the nation's values, UNAPO deigns to forge a path of dedication and clarity. There will be no policy reversals, only faithfulness to what makes Chile great. And yet, it seems impossible to reconcile the party's factional divides. How deep do these fissures go, and will they fracture the coalition?"

  CHL_idea_rural_collapse: "Rural Collapse"
  CHL_idea_rural_collapse_desc: "Fire. Fire is the only constant for Southern Chile. Larded with fire, engulfed in smoke, the curt chuffs of choking livestock can't be heard for the gunfire. The burning forests release extremists who lynch and sack to the noise of percussive explosions. The fields burn, food is scarce; the red haze is a suffocating blanket that smothers the South - a diet of hate. The only surviving political discourse is assassination, and any government action should be taken with great caution, lest the collapse creep north."

  # Minister Descriptions #
  CHL_Enrique_Escobar_hog_desc: "------------\n§LEnrique Ortúzar, a skilled lawyer and the Chilean Minister of the Interior, is a diehard loyalist of President Alessandri. This is not because he has some kind of absolute or uncompromising respect for his boss -  he is not the sort of person to be taken in by personality cults. Quite the contrary: it is because of his unyielding belief that the situation of Chile and of the FDC require his party to be unified under a single leadership rather than allowing itself to break itself up over fossilized nineteenth-century political systems of thought such as "liberalism" or "conservatism". Though conservative by FDC standards, he has facilitated a synthesis between liberal and conservative thought in the FDC; the President has found this to be indispensable in his struggle to keep the fraying party united.§!"
  CHL_Vergara_Donoso_pol_desc: "------------\n§LGermán Vergara Donoso is Alessandri's Minister of the Exterior. A skilled diplomat with more than forty years of experience, he is the main driving force behind the FDC-supervised alignment of Chile with the Organization of Free Nations. As he has served as an OFN representative for many of their efforts in Latin America, Donoso's alignment and intentions are clear. He pushes day in and day out for greater cooperation and ties with the OFN, and has thus far enjoyed great success in his efforts to that end.§!"
  CHL_Julio_Philippi_eco_desc: "------------\n§LJulio Philippi, the Minister of Economics, is an honest public servant who takes his responsibility to heart; to that end, he does his level best in the role with which he has been entrusted. He did not seek out power for himself; no, he rose naturally through the ranks by force of hard work, slowly convincing those around and above him that he was the right man for the job.\n\nPresident Alessandri noticed him and took a liking to him, as the two men have similar personalities and function on more or less the same moral code. Accordingly, they have a good working relationship that Philippi has leveraged to further his technocratic vision.§!"
  CHL_Carlos_Vial_sec_desc: "------------\n§LCarlos Vial, Alessandri's Minister of Defense, is not in fact a career officer or in any way directly related to the military. In fact, he is an engineer.\n\nThough he is not a military man, his tough, mighty personality and attitude make him the furthest thing from unmilitary; it was his strong-willed nature that made Alessandri choose him for the job. Vial's remit as Defense Minister is to ensure a good relationship and cooperation with the Chilean Armed Forces, as he recognizes that the further away the military is kept from the political sphere, the more stable the fragile Chilean democracy will be.§!"

  #### Leader Descriptions ####
  POLITICS_ALESSANDRI_DESC: "Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez, eldest son of the late President Arturo Alessandri Palma, is the heir of the influential Alessandri political family. He is different from other members of his family in that he never sought power or political influence - in fact, he holds politics in some distaste. Despite this, politics found a way to seek him out.\n\nThe young Alessandri's dream was to be an architect, but his strict father forced him into engineering. He wanted to live a normal life, but Ibáñez and his lackeys forced him into exile when he was young. Even after that experience, though he wanted peace and quiet, his family half forced him into the political spotlight. To his chagrin, he found success in the political arena when he proved greatly competent acting as the Minister of Finance during the Arturo Matte Presidency, and he has been stuck in politics ever since.\n\nPerhaps because of the way in which those around him rode roughshod over his dreams and wishes time and again, Alessandri comes off as cold and stubborn. Nonetheless, he commands authority and respect, because he has demonstrated that his concern and interest lies with the Chilean people and them alone. For that reason he is greatly respected by those close to him and by the Chilean public, who refer to him lovingly as "El Paleta" - a Chilean term for a reliable individual that is there when you need him, makes an effort when it is needed most, and has good intentions for those he cares about.\n\nThough he was chosen as the FDC's compromise candidate for the 1958 elections, Alessandri quickly grew out of that role, becoming a guiding force for both his party and his nation, and successfully handling most if not all the issues that have plagued his difficulty-ridden presidency. In 1962, two years remain in his term, and exhaustion is wearing away at his mind. The weary old campaigner will either prove himself to be up to the challenge once again or, collapsing under the burden of a hard life, finally fail to keep the nation together."

  POLITICS_PHILIPPI_DESC: "As the dust settles, it is the leader of the Technocratic faction of the FDC, Julio Philippi Izquierdo, who finds himself entrusted by the will of the People with the rule of the Chilean Republic.\n\nIf one were to ask who or what Julio Philippi Izquierdo is, the few people who know about him would describe him as "a public servant in everything he does". Unlike most prominent politicians, who make their careers shouting at each other on the screens and radio waves, Philippi was an obscure figure until a few years back. Working as a mere court lawyer in the Supreme Court of Chile, he caught the attention of the then President-elect Alessandri, who, admiring Philippi's dedication to his job, appointed him Minister of Justice.\n\nAfter the Valdivia Earthquake, Philippi's dedication and skill saw him named Minister of Economics with a view on overseeing the reconstruction of the ruined nation. His successful handling of this process, combined with his previous reputation in the government, catapulted him into the spotlight and gained him a faction of Radical Party remnants and other assorted moderates who called themselves the "Technocratic" faction of the FDC. This faction encourages adopting a more socially progressive stance, involving the state more in socioeconomic processes, and considering diplomatic and economic rapprochement with Japan and in particular the Zaibatsus of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nDescribed by those who know him as warm, informal, friendly, and selfless, Julio Philippi, far from seeking power out, seems to have been pushed into that position. But now that he is here, he will do everything in his power to leave a good legacy behind for his people, no matter the cost."

  POLITICS_ZEPEDA_DESC: "Hugo Zepeda Barrios was born in the northern province of Ovalle, in  Coquimbo. Being the son of an important Liberal politician meant that he was naturally pushed into politics; he managed to make a decent name for himself, but he stubbornly refused to join the then-dominant Liberal Party. He felt that the Liberal Party's near-dictatorial control over Chile put the health of Chilean democracy at risk, and questioned the legitimacy of his being elected under a Liberal banner. In light of these very valid grievances, it is fairly ironic that after three decades Zepeda finds himself as the head of the Liberal Party under the same circumstances that he so condemned in youth.\n\nJoining the Liberal Party after the rise of the Radical Party-led Popular Front in the late 1930s, Zepeda quickly rose through the ranks, becoming first a party organizer, and, as time wore on, a prominent leader of the opposition to the rapidly-collapsing Radical government. Zepeda began as sub-secretary of Justice during the first half of the Fernando Alessandri presidency; though this proved his worth to the Liberals, his tenure as Minister of Economics under President Arturo Matte truly cemented him as leader of the Liberal faction of the FDC.\n\nWorking with President Jorge Alessandri in neutralizing the fiscal deficit and suppressing inflation, Zepeda became one of the chief FDC-Liberal ideologues in economic policy; this, combined with his distinguished prior career, helped him attain election as President of the Liberal Party in 1956.\n\nHaving become President of the Chilean Senate in 1962, Zepeda put all his labors and leveraged all his influence to maintain the prominent position of the Liberal Party in the FDC, which at last gained him the nomination for the Presidency. His policies are simple - some might even say bland -  but they are solid: maintain economic non-intervention but promote competition and incentivize investment, preserve Chilean democratic institutions, fighting corruption, further reducing the deficit, and furthering Alessandri's policy of increasingly close cooperation with the OFN."

  POLITICS_SALVADOR_ALLENDE_DESC: "What makes a good socialist? Is it the drive to fight without ever stopping? Is it the theoretical basis that will give you the knowledge to defeat capitalism? Is it chaos and death, as some on the right would claim? To Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens, it is but a hatred of tyranny, the tyranny of inequality and the terror that it comes with. It is the willingness for all to be in good health, and be free from fear of the landlord and the dictator, and the willingness to do anything to achieve it.\n\nBorn into a well-off family of Freemasons in the city of Santiago in 1908, Allende was the great-grandson of old Chilean revolutionaries, but one would not think he was destined for radicalism in itself. Allende claims an anarchist shoemaker named Juan De Marchi inspired him, but some believe these claims to be romantic embellishment. After a short stint in the army, Allende entered the University of Chile in 1926, around the time Chilean society began to collapse in upon itself. A cycle of dictatorships and democracies ended with a bang in a military coup establishing the Socialist Republic of Chile. During this time, Allende was involved in student activism.\n\nAllende co-founded the Socialist Party of Chile in 1933, with founding father of the Socialist Republic Marmaduke Grove taking him under his wing. In 1937, Allende was elected as a deputy for Quillota and Valparaíso. After the Socialist Party and the Radicals united to push Pedro Aguirre Cerda as a presidential candidate in 1938 and won, the young Allende was appointed Minister for Health. After PAC died of tuberculosis in 1941, the Socialist Party left the coalition, and proceeded to split. Allende, now general secretary of the party, tried to hold the rump party together.\n\nAfter being elected senator in 1945, Allende became the presidential candidate of the new People's Front for 1952. He lost. In 1956, the People's Front became the FRAP, and Allende ran for president in 1958. He lost, but the result was much closer than it was six years earlier. Now, Allende has finally gotten his lucky break after the Naranjazo, but can the beloved porteño at last bring Chile together, as one whole, equal nation?"

  POLITICS_FREI_MONTALVA_DESC: "As the dust settles, it is not a member of the FDC establishment but instead the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva who finds himself entrusted by the will of the People with the rule of the Chilean Republic.\n\nEduardo Frei Montalva has always found a way to stumble into the spotlight throughout his life. A lifelong politician and activist, Frei figured prominently in the student strikes and protests that threw down the dictatorship of Ibáñez. But that was not enough for him; as leader of the disgruntled Conservative Youth, he led his disaffected faction to form a new party – the National Falange, part of which formed the basis of what was to become the broader Christian democratic movement of Chile. Though not initially successful, Frei was eventually able to be elected to office and serving as Minister of Public Works during the Rios presidency, the discontent brought by FDC incompetence and the turbulence of the 1950s bringing an opportunity which they took with both hands.\n\nWith fiery speeches, massive demonstrations, large rallies, and a perennial spot on every front page in Chile, Frei and the DC made a name for themselves time and again. In 1958, they won third place; in 1964, they grew strong enough where the embattled FDC had no choice but to back him for a joint ticket to prevent the socialists from gaining power.\n\nHaving taken power, Frei is in an excellent position to completely reshape the landscape of Chilean politics through his program of fiery advocacy for centrist public action inspired by the socioeconomic doctrine of the Catholic Church."

  POLITICS_PRAT_ECHAURREN_DESC: "As the dust settles, it is not a member of the FDC establishment but instead Jorge Prat Echaurren, leader of the UNAPO, who finds himself entrusted by the will of the People with the rule of the Chilean Republic.\n\nPerhaps Jorge Prat Echaurren was always destined to become a symbol of Chilean nationalism; he is, after all, the grandson of the renowned national hero Arturo Prat, who gave his life for his country during the naval Battle of Iquique during the War of the Pacific. As he grew up, surrounded by the Chilean Anarchy and the troubled 1930s, Prat saw something different from what Eduardo Frei or Salvador Allende saw; he saw a nation ruined by internal bickering and victimized by foreign interests while inane ideological disputes rocked the country. With that mindset it surprised nobody when the young prat joined the National Socialist Movement at a mere fourteen years of age. A militant throughout his youth, Prat eventually broke with the National Socialists out of dissatisfaction with what he perceived as the lackluster leadership and indecisive imbecility of its leader von Marées, defecting to the Conservative Party and becoming the leader of its youth faction.\n\nPrat became influential in the ideological growth of the youths he led by advocating corporativism, portalianism, and pro-Ibáñez sentiment; however, he became disgruntled with the Conservatives too, complaining of a "lack of true principles". As a result he aligned himself with – but did not join – the Agrarian Laborists. Taking his followers and attracting a mass of disgruntled Conservatives, Prat founded the PAN and spearheaded an alliance with the Agrarian Laborists, which resulted in the formation of UNAPO.\n\nThrough a combination of cunning, a hardliner's mindset, and nationalist rhetoric, Prat has become the avatar of the populist and nationalist current of Chilean politics. Having modelled himself after the late dictator Ibáñez, he may in fact be hiding an ambition to become the return of Ibáñez in the present day. What is certain, however, is that he proposes a huge shift in most aspects of the Chilean Republic."
