 POLITICS_COUNCILURG_DESC: "Originally founded in 1952 by Luis Batlle, the concept goes back to Luis Batlle's uncle, Jose Batlle y Ordoñez, who made it official in the 1918 constitution. However, after Gabriel Terra's coup d'etat in 1933, the Council was disbanded for the better part of 19 years.\n\nThe National Executive Council has gained a reputation for stalling at every point, and it is highly disliked among the people. The parliament is debating its abolition, the possibility of moving back to a presidential system, like what existed before Batlle's reform.\n\nHowever, §ROrthodox Batllists§! are absolutely livid that people are fighting to ruin Batlle's legacy, and if things go south, they won't hesitate to sabotage the §OColorado§! party. If the party is divided, the §MBlancos§! would gain power, which would undo most every step that Uruguay has taken forward with all those Reichsmarks Germany has given us. Knowing the §WHerrerists§!, they'd gladly tank the economy if that means kicking both Americans and Germans from Uruguay.\n\nAnd honestly, at this point, what's the damage done?\n\nWell, really, the damage to working class families whose jobs in the industrialised areas of the country depend mostly on German and American funding, would be monumental. And the controversial push for nationalisation of the Rincon del Bonete dam, a pet project of Fernandez Crespo, would not only harm the economy but also our relations with Germany.\n\nLet's just hope it doesn't come down to that."
 
 # Ministers #
 URG_Victor_Haedo_hog: "Eduardo Victor Haedo"
 URG_Victor_Haedo_hog_desc: "At 61 years of age and with no lack of experience, Victor Haedo is primed and ready to be the head of the executive council. After over fifty years as an opposition party, the Blancos have managed to finally attain a majority in a system designed by the Colorados. Haedo is pushing hard to keep the Blancos in power, but his nerves are getting the better of him."
 URG_Homero_Martinez_pol: "Homero Martinez Montero"
 URG_Homero_Martinez_pol_desc: "A navy man, Homero Martinez was never one to stand back and watch his country be mauled by German and American interests. Yet once he took power as Foreign Relations minister, he realised the reality of having to deal with the most powerful nations on the planet. He can't help but  bend over backwards for them. His navy experience never prepared him for this!"
 URG_Juan_Eduardo_Azzini_eco: "Juan Eduardo Azzini"
 URG_Juan_Eduardo_Azzini_eco_desc: "'The Reformer', as he's called, Juan Eduardo Azzini has truly turned the economic system in Uruguay on its head. Since his ascendance he has managed to change the way foreign currencies are exchanged, making the process simpler and easier to manage. It seems he wants to keep the cash flowing in Uruguay- efficiently, of course- and with the country profiting from the Colorados' deals with Germany, he's succeeding quite nicely and looking good in the process."
 URG_Nicolas_Storace_sec: "Nicolas Storace Arrosa"
 URG_Nicolas_Storace_sec_desc: "A father of nine children, Nicolas "Chiche" Storace is a man of unyielding will. As in his home life, his role in the government has been to keep the country stable by whatever means necessary. Crushing worker's strikes and any radical moves by the various factions, he seems set on the idea of keeping the sheep in place. And things should carry on fine, so long as no destabilizing external influence enters Uruguay. But that won't ever happen- right?"

 URG_free_breadbasket: "The Free Breadbasket"
 URG_free_breadbasket_desc: "While it has always traded with all sides, Uruguay's distaste with the Nazi system had once led it to favor the OFN in international trade. But the tempestuous winds of global markets have humbled this small nation, and the temptation of riches has led it to play a more evenhanded economic game. Since 1938 it has traded heavily with both the OFN and the Pakt.\n\n§YThe duality of trading with both the Germans and the OFN could bring unforseen economic consequences.§!"
 URG_sectarian_violence: "Political Violence"
 URG_sectarian_violence_desc: "The Uruguayan way has always been to rise up against oppression, no matter from where that oppression may spring. As a short-time dictator famously said, "Uruguayans are ungovernable". \n\nApparently, our government is oppressive. We ought to keep the radical factions that threaten to tear apart our society at bay. The Tupamaros, led by Raul Sendic, and the Death Squads, led by a council of far-right combatants, are at constant war with both the government and each other.\n\nIt is best to keep an eye on the situation."
 URG_Switzerland_of_Latin_America: "The Switzerland of Latin America"
 URG_Switzerland_of_Latin_America_desc: "Uruguay is as a shining city upon a hill, and most of her neighbors aspire to be like her. The initial reforms, funded by windfall trade profits during the First World War, were implemented by Jose Batlle y Ordoñez and provided the first great strides into social equality on the basis of class, color, and sex. With the even bigger amounts of money raked in during World War 2, these social protections could be expanded upon and perfected. Now, every party platform in Uruguay has a Batllist element to it, since the prosperity seems limitless and the population is quite happy with the situation."
