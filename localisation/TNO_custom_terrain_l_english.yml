 ### Cities
 berlin:0 "Germania"
 berlin_desc:0 "Germania may look like the shining fruit of the Führer's labor, but its roots run deep, as does the rot infecting it. Hundreds of meters below Speer's elegantly designed promenades and Hitler's megalomaniacal symbols of his will, great concrete and steel superstructures groan under the weight of the Welthauptstadt, while pumps run round the clock to keep the swamps of Old Berlin from swallowing the Führer's vision. The tremendous, and classified, cost of rebuilding Berlin far exceeded even the plunder of a dozen nations, and outside the whispering grand halls of the city centre, the Berliners of old still live like before Germania's rise, or in cheap apartment blocks for the unemployed masses."
 la:0 "Los Angeles"
 la_desc:0 "§BCity of Angels§! as the Spanish used to call it, §YLos Angeles§! is the biggest city on the West Coast and boasts the second largest populus, rivaling that of §RNew York City's.§!"
 laport:0 "Port of Los Angeles"
 laport_desc:0 "Acquired from the Americans during the peace negotiations, the ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles serve as forward bases for the Japanese Navy and are a show of Japanese might. Many Americans detest its existence, calling it a sign of weakness. While some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"
 sanfran:0 "San Francisco"
 sanfran_desc:0 "§YSan Francisco§!, or as the young ones call it: "§BSan Fran§!," is the second largest city around the West Coast area. What it lacks in population, it makes up for in density. San Francisco is the second most densely packed city, only comparable to the §RBig Apple§! itself."
 sanfranport:0 "Port of San Francisco"

 nyc:0 "New York City"
 nyc_desc:0 "The very definition of a city that never sleeps, New York City is the fruit of the labor of generations of hardworking individuals, with an astounding amount of commerce passing through it each and every day. First settled by the Dutch in 1624 as New Amsterdam, it changed hands over the centuries and now stands as a proud bastion of American freedoms, exemplified by the Statue of Liberty in its harbor. Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands. Equally attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might. There’s always something to do in New York City for any person willing to pay the right price."
 rome:0 "Roma"
 rome_desc:0 "Rome, the Eternal City, stands as the jewel of the Mediterranean and the capital of the Italian Empire. Founded millennia ago by Romulus on the banks of the Tiber, few cities- if any- can claim such an expansive history. Indeed, there's not an inch of the city that isn't rich with the legacy of the Roman Empire, the pride of Italian history. Despite the invasions, plagues, and misfortunes that have fallen on the city before, Rome has always emerged from the rubble, ready to rebuild- and, in doing so, has cemented its place as the center of Italy. It is here where the King, the Pope, and the Duce stay, and it is here that the Italian government sits, along with artists, culinary geniuses, and romantics from across the world. Make no mistake- Rome has survived thousands of years before, and- barring the apocalypse- it will survive thousands of years more."
 madrid:0 "Madrid"
 madrid_desc:0 "Previously devastated by over two years under siege during the Spanish Civil War, Madrid has recovered to become the largest and wealthiest city in Iberia. The unique and varied designs of Madrid's "Gran Vía" is admired by architects and artists the world over. Most of the country's brightest minds attend university here, nearly all Iberian films are produced here, and most of Iberia's largest companies are headquarted here. destination in the country. As Iberians increasingly choose to leave the countryside for the city, tens of thousands move to Madrid every year, this rapid expansion has made Madrid into one of the single largest cities in Europe--and there are no signs that this growth is slowing down."
