 POLITICS_SIDDIQ_ABUBAKAR_III_DESC:0 "Siddiq Abubakar III, Sultan of Sokoto, Commander of the Faithful, Sarkin Musulmi, and head of the Nigerian branch of the Qadiriyya Sufi order, is the last link in a chain that stretches back into the ancient history of this corner of Africa. Born in 1903, on the same day the British finally subjugated the Sultanate of Sokoto, Abubakar descends from the founders of the Sokoto state, who played a key role in establishing Islam in northern Nigeria. Receiving a religious education, Abubakar distinguished himself as a skilled administrator, well versed in the traditional laws of his people, before finally becoming of Sultan in 1938.\n\nAlas, his hopes of a peaceful reign were soon dashed by the war. The shadow of the British Empire, looming over Africa, was dissolved and replaced by the thundering roar of Luftwaffe bombers, and soon chaos and anarchy enveloped Nigeria as they did much of the Sahel. With the end of the bombings, Abubakar restored his rule over much of the Sokoto lands and the Fula people. Governing as a de facto absolute monarch and spiritual guide, Abubakar is embraced by much of the traditionalist upper classes of the Fula, but growing dissent from reformist voices in the realm has started to threaten the Sultan's legitimacy.\n\nWhat's worse, is that the Hausa population of Sokoto, long denied any real form of representation, is starting to resent the Fula-dominated Sultanate, as cries for Hausa self determination become louder and louder. Finally, other ethnicities on the borderlands of the Sokoto realm, mostly the Zarma and the Fulbe, are also growing restless under the Fula yoke, and are likely preparing to break free from the Sultanate. Despite all of this, Sultan Abubakar still holds on - and only time will tell if his adherence to the ancient and honoured ways of his forefathers will prove sufficient to survive in this new, cruel world."
