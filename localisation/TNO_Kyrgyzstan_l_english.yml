 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_IVAN_GRISHIN_DESC:0 "The chaos that followed the Soviet defeat against the Germans allowed many unlikely figures to find their way to the heights of power which they would be denied in any other conditions. By the irony of fate, the burden of the father of the Kirghiz nation, or at least the claim of it, was granted to an ethnic Russian officer of the peasant background. That officer was Ivan Alexandrovich Grishin, now the leader of Kirghizia.\n\nGrishin did not see the Great Patriotic War, but he was a participant in every armed conflict in Central Asia, including the involvement of the Kirghiz SSR in the West Russian War, on the side of Soviet Kazakhstan. The deaths and retirements of his superiors made him a close associate of the former supreme commander of the Kirghiz SSR and eventually a designated heir to his cause.\n\nUnlike the predecessors, Grishin bitterly accepted irreversibility of the Soviet collapse and realized the futility to restore the Soviet order in Central Asia and Russia, a hope many of Grishin's comrades gave their lives for. Rather, he dedicated his remaining years to reinstating order in the Kirghiz SSR, keeping it safe and stable, not even slightly disturbed by perturbations of the outside world. The isolationist policy proved popular among the Kirghiz population, who started to regard Grishin as their natural leader, and his charismatic figure could convince even the Communist remnants and the Kirghiz nationalist officers to  together for the benefit of the whole country, even if they would would gnaw each other's throats under anyone but Grishin. Still, it is hard to say that the position of Grishin is truly secure. A devotee of stability above everything else, he never dared to oversee the serious changes in Kirghizia it truly needs and his reluctant allies of the national coalition grow more dissatisfied with his unwillingness to implement their vision of the ideal Kirghizia. Grishin was a ruler which the Kirghiz people desperately needed, but will he prove himself to be a leader they will need for the future?"

 KYR_The_General_of_the_People:0 "The General Of The People"
 KYR_The_General_of_the_People_desc:0 "Saying that general Grishin brought order to the Kirghiz people and united them is a grave understatement. It is more correct to say that general Grishin, in his greatness, created the new Kirghizia, protecting its people and keeping them from total destruction in the confusing modern era. When the old Union fell, and as anarchy and infighting crept across Russia and Kazakhstan, the General of the people took power, saving us from that dark fate. A dictator he may be, but he dictates with the people's approval. There simply would not be a Kirghizia without general Grishin."
 KYR_The_Border_Regions:0 "The Border Regions"
 KYR_The_Border_Regions_desc:0 "Kirghizia's new greatness comes from its isolation. This brave isolation, enforced by the noble military, has kept Kirghizia strong, united, and happy. But there are those that threaten to challenge this new order, challenge the peace brought to us by general Grishin. The borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are set to explode, and tension dances across every stretch of the divide. It is only natural to expect some tense borders, of course, but Uzbekistan and Tajikistan attempt to challenge our regime with their every breath. The borders will explode one day, and we must prepare for it."
 KYR_Scavenge_for_Arms:0 "Scavenge For Arms"
 KYR_Scavenge_for_Arms_desc:0 "Kirghizia's isolation is armed. But to secure an armed isolation, arms are required. While General Grishin is strong and brave, and his wisdom is undeniable, Kirghizia's industry is still lacking, and our ability to gain new arms is highly limited. While our industry may be built up in the future, and steady production will be increased as normal, the military needs weapons now. For this reason, noble General Grishin has ordered scavenger teams into the wastes, to recover the guns that will soon be needed to keep our noble military in supply, from whatever sources present themselves."
 KYR_Bring_out_the_Big_Guns:0 "Bring Out The Big Guns"
 KYR_Bring_out_the_Big_Guns_desc:0 "If we wish to ensure Kirghizia's security, then we need to enlarge our military. If we wish to sustainably enlarge Kirghizia's military, our tactics must be improved, and things such as artillery must once again be introduced to our military force. The Soviet era had many faults, but a lack of military strength, at least in comparison to Kirghizia, was not among them. The Kirghiz lands are doubtless spotted with old relics, relics that may offer a significant improvement to our forces."
 KYR_Tajiki_Support:0 "Tajiki Support"
 KYR_Tajiki_Support_desc:0 "We disagree with the Tajiks on many things, but agreement doesn't build alliances. Rather, the Kirghiz and Tajik people share something so much greater than agreement. We share a common hatred. Uzbekistan rivals both of our peoples, threatening our existences, and threatening our peace. We may have our differences with Tajikistan, but in the name of mutual protection, those disagreements must be put aside, to prevent the Uzbek menace from ending the Kirghiz peace."

 KYR_The_Successor:0 "The Successor"
 KYR_The_Successor_desc:0 "It is impossible to summarize all the good that has come from General Grishin's leadership, and the strong hand of the general's forces has kept Kirghizia from fading from history's pages. But that great time is now over. General Grishin lies dead, and all of Kirghizia mourns. However, vultures already begin to circle around noble Grishin's body. A successor must soon be decided, or all glories of the general's era may be reduced to rubble. Only one question remains: who could possibly succeed such a great man?"
 KYR_The_Commander:0 "The Commander"
 KYR_The_Commander_desc:0 "The place of the late General Grishin was left empty, to be taken not by anyone who can claim it, but by the most capable to hold his burden and use the powers for the benefit of the people. Who could be more capable than General Kaliynur Usenbekov, one of the most trusted Grishin's lieutenants and the rising star of the Young Kirghiz officers, a group of patriotic soldiers who want to make Kirghizia stronger than ever? Due to his proximity to the General, Usenbekov found no problem to take his position for himself and defeat the  main rivals.\n\nGeneral Usenbekov respects General Grishin's noble character and his contributions for the country, but he also is not afraid to admit his two greatest mistakes, such being compromising with the disgusting Reds and the national stagnation that took place under his reign and that left undermined the country in the face of national threats. The new Commander-in-chief promises to correct the mistakes of his predecessor and set the proud nation of Kirghiz on the path of greatness, denied to us by the foreign occupants."
 KYR_The_Politician:0 "The Politician"
 KYR_The_Politician_desc:0 "In the ensuing struggle after Grishin's death, the progressive force of the Communist Party has prevailed. Comrade Sultan Ibraimovich Ibraimov, a young and popular politician of Bishkek and one of the most principled opposition leaders to the reckless and frivolous rule of Grishin, outplayed his reactionary enemies and re-established the power of the Soviets in Kirghizia. The Kirghiz SSR, after years of turning away from the path of real socialism, once again truly represents the will of the Kirghiz working class under the guidance of the revolutionary vanguard. As the new Chairman of the Kirghiz SSR, Ibraimov proclaimed a new step for the Kirghiz way to Communism and pleaded the party and the people to make every effort for building the society on Socialist principles and combating every threat to the worker's democracy coming from both within and without.\n\nGrishin left us with a hard legacy and left us disconnected with our Soviet roots. Under Ibraimov, we will overcome our difficulties and will unite with the Tajik proletariat to pursue the common goal."
 KYR_Death_to_the_Reds:0 "Death To The Reds"
 KYR_Death_to_the_Reds_desc:0 "O Allah, I hate the Communists. My grandfather hated them too, even before they stole his livestock and shot him as a ''counter-revolutionary''. Of course, general Grishin tolerated their presence not without a reason, he hoped to ensure their obedience and eventually ally Kirghizia with the Red Tajik country, but General Usenbekov is not blind to their true intentions. For years after losing their power, they pretended to be our friends and allies, only to betray our trust and restore their tyranny once again, which that snake Ibraimov attempted to do after General Grishin passed away.\n\nThere can be no peace, no peace with the Reds, men of stone, and iron, and lies! All their activities in the country should be banned and all their party bosses should be persecuted for the Bolshevik crimes they and their former masters brought upon our land."
 KYR_Enemies_on_All_Sides:0 "Enemies On All Sides"
 KYR_Enemies_on_All_Sides_desc:0 "Our aspiration for independence has left us with little friends, for most of the neighboring countries wanting to subjugate Kirghizia and make it to bow to their will. To the South, there are dogmatic Tajiks, who are still trying to climb to the dying cause of Bolshevism and support the anti-governmental fifth column within our country. To the West, there are fanatical Uzbeks who desire to ignite the flame of war across the entire region to satisfy their predatory imperialistic wishes for the ''Unified Turkestan''.\n\nOur enemies are numerous and we are left alone by ourselves to combat them, with only the bravery and strength of our men to rely on. Let them know that we will show no fear and will not succumb an inch of our national pride."
 KYR_The_Red_South:0 "The Red South"
 KYR_The_Red_South_desc:0 "Of course, the independence from the Soviet power brought uncertainty, but, more importantly, it brought freedom from the Muscovite oppression for those who languished in the prison of nations. The Soviet Tajik country, however, refused to take the gifts of liberty and chooses to cling for the dying Bolshevik ideals, dragging their people into a historical oblivion with their adherence to the self-destructive Marxist beliefs.\n\nEven if they show no signs of aggression, their behaviour should not fool us, as they reluctancy lies not in their seeming peacefulness, but in their cowardice. Knowing that they can't defeat us with force, they resort to trickery and try to sponsor the Communist insurgency in our home. As their ideology dictates animosity towards any country that does not desire to bow to the Communist Party, we should not expect any peaceful resolution to our conflict. We should act decisively and destroy the Communist threat abroad as we destroyed within our borders!"
 KYR_The_Black_West:0 "The Black West"
 KYR_The_Black_West_desc:0 "The Communists of Tajikistan are not the only threat to our acquired freedom. Uzbekistan, which once tried to follow the republican ideals and sought peace with its neighbors, was overtaken by a Fascist madman Veli Kayum-khan, a laughable imitator of Führer Adolf Hitler and a pompous despot of Tashkent. Not satisfied with oppressing his own people, he wants to spread his rotten ideology of "Pan-Turkism" across the whole Central Asia, claiming it in the name of the common benefit of peoples of Central Asia, but everyone with a clear mind understands that his calls for the Turkic unity in the end serve nothing else but his urge for power.\n\nThe looming shadow of the Black State in Uzbekistan has not evaded Kirghizia as well. Many times his goons in the streets called to wage war upon our people and many times the Uzbek government tried to provoke us for a decisive action. Let this scum know that if they decide to pick on us again, they will not caught us unprepared."

With our men marching in Tashkent and Dushanbe, no neighboring country presents any danger to us anymore. The Kirghiz nation, faced with a great challenge it had to pay for freedom, proved its might.\n\nOf course, leaving the humiliated peoples on their own, without our supervision, after the woeful defeat they have endured, would be a reckless mistake on our part, for too many have not accepted the failure of their incompetent governments and too many would seek their vengeance the very second we turn our sight away from the conquered lands. Until we will be confident in the purity of their thoughts and we will find a friendly and trustworthy officer among their nation to lead them, we will maintain our direct governance over the lands of what was once Uzbekistan and Tajikistan"

Citing the nonsensical reasons and our completely fictional activities to sabotage the government of the late Ivan Grishin, the Kirghiz envoy of Usenbekov demanded from us and completely abandon our allegiance to the Soviet system, something which we could only refuse, even if at the expense of relationships with our neighbor.\n\nIf there was any hope to build a stable anti-Fascist coalition with Kirghizia, disregarding our serious ideological disagreements, it was stamped by the militarist boot that marched in Bishkek. Now we are completely left alone to stand against not just one, but two anti-democratic regimes that seek to spread their terror to Tajikistan. No matter the threat, we should prevail against our enemies at all cost!"

That's why they tried to approach us in the past, to not strengthen the remaining Soviet order, but merely preserve their fragile position from the impending threat of the Fascist Uzbek empire. But now, following the death of the adept opportunist Grishin, the newly reorganized government of Comrade Sultan Ibraimov set the country on the right track, proclaiming the immortal values of the October Revolution and the international solidarity of the Kirghiz SSR with its friendly Socialist states, including our own beloved Tajikistan.\n\nWith ideological and class barriers no longer standing between our nations, our Kirghiz friends proposed to build an alliance based on mutual friendship and sharing the common goal, that's being our commitment to the teaching of Marx and Lenin and hostility to every manifestation of fascism."
