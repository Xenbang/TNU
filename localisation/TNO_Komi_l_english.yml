 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC:0 "Originally only a middle-level Soviet statesman, Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky found himself as the only guarantor of democracy, flawed as he is, in a small piece of the former Soviet Union. Being remarkable among his peers for extraordinary talents in the economic science and administrative work, Voznesensky was chosen by the Red Army Stavka on the eve of the West Russian War to oversee the recovery mission in the Komi ASSR. For his service to the Soviet province, Voznesensky acquired a considerable popularity among the people of Komi, who saw him as the benevolent statesman wishing to put the benefit of a common man ahead of the bickering and intrigues between the power-hungry Soviet cliques.\n\nAs the result of endless power plays between the Front and the hardline Communist bureaucrats in Syktyvkar, the now-president of the Komi ASSR Voznesensky remained as the sole figurehead in the Republic who could boast about the public support. Disillusioned with the Orthodox Marxist dogma and remaining bitter about the incompetence and pettiness of the Soviet higher-ups that nearly brought Komi to destruction, he reshaped the political system of the Republic into a representative democracy, where the voice of every man or woman can be heard and will be heard, breaking away with the single-party dictatorship.\n\nAlthough the hard efforts of Voznesensky brought daily bread and a sense of confidence for average Komi citizens, the reputation of Syktyvkar brought many unsavory people to the city who seek nothing but to eliminate the democracy of Komi through her own institutions. But challenges to Voznesensky come not only from the extremists, but also from his fellow democratic politicians, who question the capability of Voznesenky to maintain the republican values, citing his abrasive and inappropriate behavior for a man of his position and his embarrassing ties to various Socialist groups. However, despite the political pressure, Voznesensky is not a person who wants to abandon the system he envisioned without a fight."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was one of the children of Josif Stalin, a Georgian member of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and one of Nikolai Bukharin's fiercest rivals. Although her father vanished from the historical record during the Great Patriotic War, Svetlana was able to safely survive the chaotic evacuation of Moscow and came to find refuge in Sykvytkar, capital of the fledgling Komi Republic. While her father was infamous in Party circles for being a hardliner and socialist ideologue, his parenting seems to have driven Svetlana in the opposite direction, and she quickly associated herself with Komi's rapidly growing political center. They welcomed her as a stabilizing force in a chaotic political system, and she quickly became a figurehead for the fragile center to rally around.\n\nNow that the political situation in Komi has deteriorated, Stalina has stepped up and decided to take the reins of state herself. Although she has resorted to some rather authoritarian methods to maintain order, she insists that they are temporary measures in the name of stability, and that she will soon fully restore democracy to Komi. Some are skeptical of her claims, but her actions still trend toward the center, and she is a far more pleasing candidate for many than the alternatives."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has been praised by her supporters as one of the few voices of stability or sanity in western Russia, and by her enemies as an authoritarian in denial, an opportunist who would take any chance she could to destroy the perceived radicalism she so hates.\n\nWhatever the case, Stalina's success as a politician is as unmatched as her story tragic. Her father, Iosif Stalin, was a Soviet bureaucrat and early supporter of Bukharin, who had died in an industrial accident rumored to be orchestrated on the orders of the Soviet government. In the long period following the death of Stalin, she has lost more and more - her mother, in the Great Patriotic War, her husband, purged by the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and her eldest brother, killed by friendly fire during the collapse of the Front at the end of the West Russian War.\n\nIndeed, Stalina claims that the war is where she first tasted the bite of radicalism, and when she vowed to oppose it at all costs. Stalina's party, the Sovereign Democratic Party, or PSD, gained prominence in the Komi Republic as a big tent comprised of big tents, a place for all who valued a safe and stable Russia over all else. Though Stalina's policies often borrow from left-wing populist principles, it would be most unwise to mistake her for a Marxist, as her father was. The basis for her political stances exists in the principles of "sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism" - the construction of a strong, independent Russia through an assertive foreign policy, heavy support for public welfare, and a strong, modern military.\n\nThrough the democratic process she fought so long to protect, the people have given Stalina their mandate, and the Lady of Steel stands prepared to defend her beloved Motherland from all enemies that may assail it - even if that danger is the unchecked will of the people itself."

 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC:0 "Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov - a name surrounded by either love or suspicion, depending on how much one actually knows about the man. Zhdanov is one of Komi's key politicians, a proud socialist leader with experience from chairing the Leningrad Communist Party before the Great Patriotic War, Zhdanov ended up entangled with the government of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, serving as an influential figure in an attempt to encourage Russian cultural unity against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the Front fell, and with it, Zhdanov's beloved universal cultural program. When the government fled to Syktyvkar and promptly dissolved, Zhdanov stayed behind, forming ties with Mikhail Suslov in the series of coups and power struggles that preceded the formation of the Republic. Despite his more authoritarian socialist stances in the early days of the Republic, Zhdanov has recently taken to pushing for more libertarian initiatives - democratization of a Komi socialist state, encouraging growth of minority culture, and reconciliation with the center-left. Additional initiatives he has supported include a greater synthesis of universal culture, science, and ideology into a general doctrine of Zhdanovshchina, increasing prioritization towards research into scientific management within the Communist Party, and creating standards for 'revolutionary art'.\n\nStill, paranoia seems to follow him, as persistent rumors push the idea that his true nature is not truly changed, but rather lying deep below the surface, waiting for him to acquire true power."

 POLITICS_ALEXEI_KOSIGIN_DESC:0 "An economic mastermind, Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin is one of the many people to have made himself part of the chaotic politics in Komi. Starting as the director of a textile mill, he was a supporter of the Bolshevik cause but only began to climb the hierarchy of the party and its nation-wide bureaucracy a few years before the war. By the time the Great Patriotic War had begun, Kosygin had been noted by the Soviet leadership as a trustworthy Party member and an overall clever individual. During the small time window between the beginning of the German invasion and the complete collapse of the motherland, he played a key role in evacuating industry to the east. His whereabouts following the dissolution of Bukharin's government remained unknown, until years later, when he emerged in the newly formed Komi Republic. There, Kosygin distinguished himself as a brilliant economist, and a vocal proponent of the Center coalition that held the country together.\n\nSoon, he would found the Union of Young Reformers, a party of his own which still allied with President Voznesensky, but clearly followed a separate agenda. Eventually, while the coalition he belonged in held out against radicals, the Young Reformers were able to usurp power from the dominant coalition leader, and now Kosygin has become the new President. Unlike Voznesensky and his absurdly close relation with certain factions of the Left, he has been clear on this issue: there will be no negotiation and no alliances with radicals on either side of the political spectrum, no matter what. The democrats must stand on their own, and create an economic power that can challenge other contenders for the reunification of Russia - Kosygin always being the designer of these ingenious plans for reform. How far these reforms will go remains to be seen."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC:0 "Despite his humble origins, having been born in a rural community near the Volga, Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov has made a name for himself in his homeland. Starting from the Communist Youth, Suslov quickly became a prominent member of the Bolsheviks in Rostov and even managed to entangle himself in the local administration of the Party.\n\nWhen the Germans attacked, Suslov was designated to orchestrate guerrillas in the Caucasus. With the arrival of Wehrmacht forces, he was nowhere to be seen. There were rumours that he continued fighting in the woods, or that he was hanged by the garrison, but these rumours were soon proved false for the people of Arkhangelsk, as the man appeared in the city so far away from his home. Soon, just like when he was young, he entered the political stage of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Climbing up the hierarchy, he became one of the most prominent WRRF politicians, and soon, was granted the prestigious position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the passage of time, Suslov was becoming even more influential and it was believed he could be the next Premier. Then, the West Russian War happened.\n\nAs the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, Suslov found himself in the city of Syktyvkar, along with economic planner Nikolai Voznesensky. Together, they carefully created the Komi Republic, but soon this uneasy pact would end as each side had a different vision for the country. Suslov quickly used his position as leader of the red paramilitaries to gain power and influence, and managed to make himself an integral part of the Republic in political and military affairs, which meant removing him from the equation would not be easy. Having remained a puppet master for a long time, Suslov has finally come out to assume leadership as the Komi Republic has become a socialist state, allowing him to carry out his plan for governing the country."

 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC:0 "Boris Nikolayevich Ponomaryov has long been the face of the Komi Republic's Socialists, yet he is not its true leader. A relatively unremarkable historian and party functionary in the final years of Bukharin's Soviet Union, by sheer luck, he was able to flee the German invasion. With the collapse of the united Front in West Russia, Ponomaryov had to once again abandon his comfort, and headed to the newly established Komi Republic, a safe haven for political radicals and revolutionaries like him.\n\nIn Syktyvkar, he was able to come in contact with many supporters of the Revolution, those who wanted a return to the ways of old, before the glorious Union fell. As far away as that dream seemed, it still gained the support of Ponomaryov, who was quickly entangled in the webs of the left wing of the Republic. One man who was particularly keen on including him in his machinations was Mikhail Suslov, the "Puppetmaster". By propelling him to prominence in the party, and securing him a position in the National Assembly as well as some degree of power, Suslov could ensure Ponomaryov's loyalty, who was satisfied with what he had.\n\nNow, the socialists have finally made their move, and one of their loyal members has been expectedly assigned the position of General Secretary. As nothing more but a puppet of the men pulling the strings, Ponomaryov lacks real influence, and remains merely a strong figurehead for the government and population, as well as a way for his allies to remain in the shadows. However, he is absolutely content with that."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC:0 "The story of Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky is as anomalous as his personality and political views. Born to a Russian merchant and Jewish seamstress, Taboritsky was nevertheless a staunch Russian monarchist and earnest anti-Semite from an early age, trying to get rid of the "Cain's seal" inherited from his mother. Becoming an exile in the Weimar Republic following the Russian Civil War, he acquitanced himself with Russian reactionary circles, reinforcing his beliefs and helping to spread the infamous 'Protocols of Zion' in Germany. Along with his long-time friend Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, he assassinated a former Russian Kadet politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov in attempt to bring revenge upon those whom he considered the main instigators of the revolution that ruined the Russian Tsardom. As the NSDAP came to power in Germany, he became one of the most enthusiastic collaborators with the Nazi regime among the White émigrés, hoping that the German dominance would pave a road for the restoration of monarchy in Russia.\n\nLike others, Taboritsky joined Vladimir in Vyatka, but soon he became displeased with who he claimed was the 'impostor Tsar', sincerely believing that the true Emperor of Russia, Tsarevich Alexey, miraculously survived and will arrive to his subjects should they prove their loyalty to their rightful ruler. Few in Vyatka could share his eccentric beliefs, but soon he found his following in Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nA person too unhinged for his enemies and friends alike, Taboritsky, however, succeeded to outplay them all and emerge as the sole ruler of the city, claiming the title of the Imperial Regent for Tsar Alexey II for himself. Few expect Taboritsky's delusions to come true, but few doubt his rule will be anything but ferocious one, as his zeal is fueled by long-standing hatred for Bolsheviks and anyone who betrayed the Russian Tsar in his darkest hour."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC:0 "The mask has finally slipped, and the clock now ticks ever forward. Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky, formerly the dark horse of the Passionariyy Organization, has finally secured utter control of the state, and his plans for its future could not be any more disturbing - at least to his many detractors.\n\nOnce again harnessing the talent for oratory that ensured the relevance of his Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire even when, by all accounts, it should have been entirely subsumed by the larger Organization, he has now announced that very restoration. Claiming to rule as regent for the Tsar Alexei II, who he states escaped execution by the Bolsheviks long ago, he routinely issues thunderous appeals to those who value traditionalism and Imperial nostalgia, and couples these appeals with open and extremely virulent anti-Semitism.\n\nTo those supporters, relatively numerous as they may be, it is as if God himself descended, in the form of Taboritsky, from Heaven in order to save the Empire. To everybody else, he is an abject madman, as unstable as he is dangerous, and as opposition coalesces, both within the state and within his own mind, the question is clear:\n\nHow long until the clock strikes midnight?"

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DEAD_DESC:0 "A deafening silence fills the airwaves. The clock has stopped, its hands frozen in time. No new missives are sent out bearing the personal seal of the Blessed Regent.\n\nYet the brazen gears keep turning, grinding heathen corpses into mulch in the name of a lost child. Blood continues to saturate the soil as the Regent's butchers vivisect the Motherland in search of a cancer that does not exist. Ever more skulls are piled high in the ossuary once known as Russia.\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes. Every soldier and bureaucrat who chose to follow the Regent's bidding continues to do so. Numbering in their millions, each slathered from crown to heels in gore and reeking of poison, they know there is no choice. They know that the Regent and Tsarevich Alexei are watching. Justice knows each of their names and will hold them accountable for failure. Beneath the guns of fanatical overseers, their nightmarish harvest continues. In time, the Lord will reward them for the sacrifice of their humanity, and the Tsarevich himself will clothe them in golden glory.\n\nBut there is no purity left in their wake, only putrefaction and decay. There is no sanctity, only defilement. There is no peace, only the silence of a million mass graves.\n\nAbove all, there is only the cold, dead gaze of a corpse, staring out into an empty room through clouded eyes as rot sets into its withered flesh."

 POLITICS_BURGSYS_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "§RRemain calm.\n\nThe Regent endures.\n\nAlexei lives.\n\nThe Holy Russian Empire shall endure.\n\nThere is much to be done.§!"

 POLITICS_LEV_GUMILEV_DESC:0 "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov, the only child of famous poets Anna Akhmatova and Nikolay Gumilyov, spent most of his youth being persecuted by the Soviet power for his unreliable ancestry and unorthodox scholarly views. In the years of his exile and wandering across Russia, he thoroughly studied history and ethnography, introducing the concept of passionarity, which postulates that the rise and fall of every historical ethnos is driven by the Passionariyy, the few people who change their environment and society to their vision, driving the history of their people forward. Instead of reducing his discovery to a merely academic matter, he saw that the salvation of Russia lies in the practical application of his theory and fancied himself as the one who will bring the passionarity of the Russian super-ethnos to its maximum heat. Being rejected and ignored by Russian warlords, Gumilyov found his supporters in Komi, among those Russians who felt betrayed and disenfranchised by the Bolsheviks and democrats alike.\n\nGumilyov's deep erudition, amiable personality and impeccable charisma attracted almost every shade of the right-wing in Ust-Sysolsk under his banner, making him the patriarch of the Russian nationalism overnight. The Passionariyy initially were considered an underdog of the Komi politics, however, as Gumilyov proved himself not just as an ardent Russian patriot and charming, if slightly eccentric, ideologue, but also as a ruthless manipulator who does not shun any means to achieve his goals, the right-wing extremism became a force that prevailed over every other political group in Komi.\n\nThough Gumilyov emerged as an indisputable master of Ust-Sysolsk, his ultimate agenda remains unknown to anyone due to his chameleonic and sometimes even opportunistic nature. Whether if he wishes to appeal to the whims of his nationalistic supporters or he decides to pursue his own dream of the Eurasian civilizational empire, the whole Russia stands in waiting of his Scythian advance to bring the dying Western world down."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_BUKHARINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Nikolayevna Bukharina was brought up at the very top of Soviet society, being the daughter of General Secretary Nikolai Bukharin. She spent her youth in the Union's best academies, attending galas and cultural exhibitions with the Party's uppermost echelons, and carefully observing her father's debates and political maneuvers. When the Union disintegrated and Bukharin vanished, so did Svetlana. Rumors flew that she had escaped with her father and gone into hiding, gotten "disappeared" by a political rival, or even hiding in a secret bunker complex beneath Moscow. Those rumors were quashed when she eventually resurfaced in Syktyvkar, capital of the (relatively) democratic post-Soviet Komi Republic. But her idle years had not dulled her political edge.\n\nMany in Komi's socialist movement saw that having her as a figurehead would be a massive propaganda coup, and quickly worked to gain her willing support. But they did not anticipate that she would have ambitions of her own. Through careful manipulation and backroom deals, Svetlana was able to build up a powerful support base, and ended up launching an internal coup against the ideologues who once tried to control her. Now that she sits at the top of Komi's political ladder, people wonder - or fear - what her next move will be. Few believe that her vaulting ambition has run out, and many suspect she may soon turn her eye toward the rest of her father's former domain..."

 POLITICS_IVAN_SEROV_DESC:0 "Ivan Alexandrovich Serov is a man to which the term 'former' has often - and correctly - been applied. Former friend and political ally of Mikhail Suslov. Former supporter of orthodox Marxism-Leninism. And, now, former political contender. For having established firm control over the state as a whole, he is now in a position to determine its future.\n\nThat future is his own vision of the political philosophy of so-called 'Ordosocialism' - an eclectic mixture of far-left socialism and far-right nationalism, and one where Russian exceptionalism, in many fields and areas, is strongly emphasized. Although considered an inherent oxymoron by many, Serov is firmly committed, as least ostensibly, to ensuring its representation within the policies of the state.\n\nThough none can say with certainty what the positions he intends to take will be, it can be reasonably expected that, under the tenets of Ordosocialism, they will include the formation of a strong authoritarian state, a dramatic increase in military expenditures, a rise in revanchist propaganda, and aggressive approaches to territorial expansion."

 POLITICS_IGOR_SHAFAREVICH_DESC:0 "Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich is many things to many people. Fascist. Democrat. Reformist. Radical. Anti-semite. Patriot. But if there's one thing that people do not call him, it is unintelligent. Shafarevich, born to a moderately successful family living in Moscow, was from a young age gifted at mathematics. A remarkable genius for his age, he was enrolled in a university level math course, even entering his final undergraduate year at Moscow University without having finished the 9th grade. His future never seemed brighter, until the German arrived.\n\nForced to flee Moscow, he was evacuated to the east, in Komi, never to see Moscow again. As Russia was consumed in warlordism, Shafarevich became involved in politics in Komi, a rump state carved up after the failure that was the West Russian War. There, he rose up the ranks of the right wing Passionariyy organization, leading the party's moderate faction, much to the chagrin of Gumilyov and his faction.\n\nDeveloping a right wing ideology known as 'Passionate Conservatism', Shafarevich has made himself popular among more reformist rightists in the party, those favoring working within the democratic system. Despite this, he has been accused of fascism, anti-semitism, as his hatred of the 'small nation' (a group of 'anti-national elites' whose values are completely at odds with Russia) echoes that of the hatred of Jews and other minority groups. Now, as leader of Komi, he will fully implement his vision of a better, more stable, order."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC:0 "Known throughout the Republic as the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Fyodorovich Katushev was, originally, an engineer and industrialist in Gorky, working to administer one of the vast factory complexes there under the purview of General Averin and his brigade of armored raiders.\n\nWith their collapse, and the re-integration of the now-renamed Nizhny Novgorod into the Republic, he quickly entered politics, winning the endorsement of the Young Reformers and election as the region's Governor. A phenomenally skilled organizer, administrator, and perhaps most importantly, orator, Katushev quickly grew to dominate his party, centralizing operations in Nizhny Novgorod and shaping its policies along staunchly liberal lines. He was elected party leader in short order, and soon after stood for President.\n\nOnce again demonstrating his talent as a politician, he led the Reformers to victory, and was elected as President. Now so empowered, he intends absolutely to put his liberal policies into practice, shifting the Reformers - and the country - away from their and its socialist roots, and towards a liberal future he considers far superior."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_YAKOVLEV_DESC:0 "Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev's career is one marked by remarkable change and evolution. Born to a peasant family in Korolyova, Yakolev's father was a Red Cavalryman during the Civil War and an important leader in the local agricultural commune. Raised in such an environment, at a young age he became an ideological adherent to Marxist-Leninism. Under normal circumstances, he might have even become an important local politician, and maybe even beyond. But the German invasion changed all that.\n\nConscripted in the Red Army, Yakovlev saw how easily Marxist-Leninism fell to the hoards of German soldiers, crushed beneath the tire treads of Panzers, then, after it was all done, shattered into a thousand bickering generals and warlords. Such destruction forced Yakovlev to view socialism through a different, more independent lens - a view that placed human dignity above ideological purity.\n\nOriginally a member of Zhukov's clique in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has adapted well to the Russian Republic, organizing the Arkhangelsk Oblast into a DSNP stronghold. A firm member of his party's left flank, he has made himself famous as an orator of populist values. Now, as President and successor to Voznesensky, he intends to take both the party and the Republic in a different direction, and to ensure, once and for all, that all citizens are happy and free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_DESC:0 "One of the youngest senior figures within the Ultravisionary faction, Nikolai Semyonovich Kardashev is also perhaps one of the most prominent, inextricably linked with the movement through his development of one of its foundations - the eponymous Kardashev scale.\n\nA method of evaluating the level of technological advancement of a society he, along with everyone else within the faction, ensures that every policy acts to increase it. This, together with his natural administrative abilities and affable personality, allowed him to rapidly advance towards the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nA physicist by education and trade, Kardashev takes his goal of scientific advancement very seriously. Despite this, however, he is not a member of the so-called 'orthodox' wing of the faction, and indeed disagrees with many of their projects and pursuits. Dismissing the many pseudo-scientific pursuits of others towards a nebulous 'superculture,' he instead concentrates upon economic affairs.\n\nThis expresses itself in his tireless advocacy and pursuit of developments supporting what he considers to be true ultravisionary socialism - a fusion economy where science serves the people and permits the creation of a post-scarcity society. Though many scoff at this dream, Kardashev knows it is achievable.\n\nAnd he intends to make sure that it is so realized."

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_CHELOMEI_DESC:0 "A longtime member of the Ultravisionary faction, Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomei became a household name within the movement through his tireless participation - and enormous success - within the Federation's space program.\n\nTrading on this recognition, as well as his ability to muster support amongst a broad range of influential figures within the Federation, he has been able to rapidly advance his standing, ascending to fill the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nOne of the most prominent members of what could be considered the 'orthodox' wing of the Ultravisionary movement, Chelomei unsurprisingly holds true to many of the core tenets laid down by Zhdanov and other central figures. This includes strong support for initiatives relating to space exploration as well as the ideological concept of the ultravisionary superculture.\n\nIndeed, he believes this to such an extent that he holds it as a simple fact that space is the natural 'next frontier' of the terrestrial Cold War. Securing victory in space, therefore, means securing victory on Earth, and vice versa.\n\nAnd he intends to do everything possible to ensure that the Federation achieves that victory."

 POLITICS_ANDREI_ZHDANOV_ULTRAVIS_DESC:0 "An Ultravisionary future is within grasp, and Andrei Zhdanov has no intention of allowing it to slip through his, or the state's, fingers.\n\nHaving occupied senior positions in Bukharin's old Soviet Union, the Komi Republic's old Assembly and now, of course, in the position of highest authority within the Federation, Zhdanov is well-accustomed to power, which he has used to advance not only his own cause, but also the cause of the Ultravisionary movement in general.\n\nHe carried it to victory through the chaos of the late Republic. He presented it with a clear path forward. With well-defined objectives that he had meticulously crafted and patiently explained to lesser men. And he had thought his confederates to have supported his view entirely.\n\nBut such was not the case. The rot had set in. Compromise and deviancy had corrupted the agenda, diverting resources and attention from critical projects, scientific and otherwise. The very destiny of the Federation itself was at stake, and as a true visionary, Zhdanov could not remain idle.\n\nRoundly denouncing and taking decisive action against the libertarians and other holders of unorthodox interpretations of the Ultravisionary agenda, Zhdanov has now reasserted his authority over the movement. Now firmly in absolute control, he can turn both his attention and the resources of the state, finally and once again, outwards.\n\nTo the stars - and beyond."

 NIK_the_minutes_of_the_congress_desc:0 "Another year has passed, and our coalition's Congress has managed to run our republic as well as they can, given our... unfortunate situation. However, the cracks are beginning to show, and factionalism within the republic and even our coalition is growing at an incredible rate.\n\nIf we are to continue our custodianship of Komi, and prevent the radicals from taking power, we must act quickly and decisively to put our enemies down."
 NIK_the_last_years_of_the_voznesentsi_desc:0 "Our ruling coalition is headed by the most left-wing democratic faction - the 'Voznesentsi' under Nikolai Voznesensky. Under their guidance, Komi has seen significant improvement, rebuilding from the bombs, lowering the death toll, and attracting refugees to our towns and cities. However, all is not quite well. Voznesensky's ties to the far left, specifically Andrei Zhdanov, are quite alarming, and a source of constant discomfort among the more conservative members of the coalition.\n\nTime will only tell if the Voznesentsi will be able to keep their position at the head of the party, or if another wing will take their place."
 NIK_speak_with_stalina_desc:0 "Svetlana Stalina, daughter of the famous Soviet bureaucrat Iosef Stalin, is one of our most valuable assets in crafting effective means of keeping radicalism down. Her plans, though often ruthless and prioritizing effectiveness, are generally excellent, and have proven a good foil to our rivals' constant scheming.\n\nKeeping her loyalty, and opening our party up to more of her influence, is considered by many to be a critical part of keeping our hegemony. Despite several of the more principled democrats' complaints about her alleged authoritarianism, approaching her can surely only help us."
 NIK_our_paramilitaries_reports_desc:0 "Straight from our paramilitary commander, Petro Grigorenko, comes the latest observations of the eyes of the streets. The previous reports have not given us much confidence in our abilities to control the ever-so-important avenues and roadways of the Komi Republic, and this report is no different.\n\nMore and more, the paramilitaries under the control of Suslov and Gumilyov march onto the streets, controlling warehouses, voting stations, and even entire neighborhoods of Syktyvkar, while our forces falter and shrivel in both their control of democratic-aligned districts and the ability to defend what we have left. We must do something about this now, before the average citizen of Komi cannot turn his or her eye without seeing radicals damaging our democracy."
 NIK_the_government_in_check_desc:0 "Nothing in our government has been spared from danger, in one way or another. While we have essentially twiddled our thumbs, both the left and the right have plotted, calculated, and made their moves - with no counterattack from us.\n\nWe are essentially a king with two rooks flanking it. There are only a few moves we are allowed to make, and we must make the right one - lest a mistake is made, and our game is over. The plans to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi must be observed and changed with haste. The fate of the Republic depends on it."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_left_desc:0 "While Gumilyov is a small pest in the byzantine game of Komi politics, a far greater threat must be dealt with: the radical leftists, led by the puppetmaster Suslov and his cronies. With the streets becoming ever more occupied by his paramilitaries, and his poll numbers showing a gradual increase, the emergency to deal with is on this side of the political spectrum.\n\nTo counter this, we must become the Suslov of democracy. No minion of the Communist Party shall be spared from the watchful eyes of our government, and soon, the plotting leaders of the far left shall have to contend with our plans to take them down."
 NIK_observe_leftist_paramilitaries_desc:0 "In our nation, marching paramilitaries down the street may as well be our way of greeting each other. The paramilitary is the lifeblood and invisible hand of every party, including ours, and every plotter with a bit of sense knows it.\n\nBecause of the status and importance of the paramilitary in our Republic, simply watching what their thugs do and say will grant us access to valuable information regarding their plans. Through agents and citizen observations, we can figure out when and where the enemy is - from hour to hour."
 NIK_the_spreading_red_influence_desc:0 "From the mundane restaurant conversations to the poll booths, talks and areas begin to take on a shade of red and gold, hammer and sickle. Those who speak of them in a positive light are no longer far-leftists, but slowly, also ordinary citizens.\n\nThe dissemination of communistic and socialistic propaganda must be halted through our paramilitaries, and our own information for the citizens will replace it. Polling booths will become more guarded, and suspected citizens shall be checked for any left-wing activities. We shall stop their efforts here."
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_right_desc:0 "Even if they are helping us defeat the leftist threat, it seems the situation on the right has not developed to our advantage.\n\nWhile we have been dealing with the communist threat, it seems the fascists have taken advantage of this opportunity to expand their influence and scope. Much like the left, talks of new graffiti, voter intimidation, and paramilitary assaults from Gumilyov have spread throughout our political sphere, and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon. A meeting must be called, and a plan to deal with this new threat must be drafted and carried out."
 NIK_a_new_face_question_desc:0 "Apparently, due to our efforts to crack the left, a split in their party has developed. While this is good for us, very much so, a conundrum has appeared: we do not know who exactly is splitting from the Communists.\n\nThe person has already gained much influence in the party - that much is already known. Said person also was, reportedly, once a lieutenant of Suslov, but has broken away on his (or her) own accord. And whoever this person is now wields much power on the left. Anything about this new leader is derived from those three tidbits of information, and that is all. We must try to find out who this new contender in the political game of Komi is, and quickly - before this new splinter of the left moves to attack."
 NIK_eyes_straight_ahead_desc:0 "While it might seem tempting to classify one side or the other as the "greater evil", our belief is that both sides are a dangerous force to democracy, and that dealing with one side will only strengthen the other.\n\nThe true solution is not to attack others, but to defend ourselves. Democracy can, and will work - all that is needed is the will of our government to fix the problems that are afflicted on us, and the will of the people to resist radical aggression. Stimulating both of these things will help us tremendously in our survival, and allow the Republic to continue existing for the people."
 NIK_distance_from_zhdanov_desc:0 "A source of uneasiness among our government is regarding our leader, Comrade Voznesensky, and rumors surrounding his connections. Allegedly, Voznesensky has ties with the far-left Andrei Zhdanov, even a friendship on the personal level.\n\nEven though we believe these rumors are a Suslovite plot to divide us, they are still deeply concerning, and of course, rumors come from somewhere. Just in case, it is best to implore Comrade Voznesnesky to cut any ties with Zhdanov, and to distance ourselves from any of his parties and actions in general."
 NIK_reinforce_the_center_desc:0 ""Remember, comrades, that the Republic's hopes do not lie in the evil lies of the radicals. Such falsities are there to lure those of us who may not be confident in our governing, to snare them and to brainwash our citizens to serve the aims of the radicals! The solution to these lies is to hold out. No more citizens shall be lost to Suslov or Gumilyov!"\n\nStalina's speech to the legislators outlined our plan to combat the radicals. The center must hold, and to do so, we must muster every effort we can to preserve it and stop others from falling into the hands of the far-left or far-right."
 NIK_the_face_of_the_movement_desc:0 "Svetlana Stalina: asset, orator, fighter.\n\nStalina has in recent times become ever-more important to maintaining the flame of the Republic, and has quickly risen in publicity and fame to the citizens of Komi. An avid anti-revolutionary, her speeches and actions directly confront the threat of the enemies in Syktyvkar and beyond, driving many to our democratic ideology. Now, we will need her more than ever, to stamp the radicals out."
 NIK_let_them_burn_themselves_out_desc:0 "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, is how the saying supposedly goes. Of course, they are not actually our friends, so to speak, but they are very useful tools for cementing our Republic.\n\nThe left wing and the right wing hate democracy, this is true, but to them, there's something even worse than that, that they declare their mortal enemy to combat at all times: each other. Even now, their paramilitaries battle in the streets, looking to obtain ideological supremacy throughout Syktyvkar and the Republic. Of course, once the 'winning' side of these battles are depleted... they won't even bother to put up a fight against us."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_right_desc:0 "Shadows lie in wait throughout our Republic. Their darkness hides under the surface of Syktyvkar, waiting, biding their time, plotting to strike.\n\nThese shadows belong to none other than Lev Gumilyov, united leader of Komi's right wing paramilitaries, and possibly some politicians. While the left can be negotiated with, the plots of Gumilyov will not stop until our downfall. We must focus on the right, and bring them down - starting by listening with our eyes and ears."
 NIK_armed_activities_desc:0 "Right-wing paramilitaries in Komi are well-known for showing little restraint in their intentions and armament. Through the streets, they march with pipes, daggers, and even pistols and rifles in order to intimidate anyone who would be willing to speak out or confront them.\n\nHowever, there is a method to Gumilyov's madness. By keeping track of patterns, noting down locations, and documenting actions, it is possible to obtain information that Gumilyov may not want us to know about - all the better for us."
 NIK_the_extent_of_the_shadow_desc:0 "While Gumilyov is agreed among our government to be the general leader of the far-right, we have not been able to agree on much else. Gumilyov's specialty is distorting and hiding his connections and ties, which sometimes makes it near-impossible to determine how much of his influence is present within our Republic and its institutions. To defeat Gumilyov, we must first reveal where Gumilyov hides. Through our observations and research, the puppetmaster of the right shall finally have his agents brought to light."
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_left_desc:0 "Crudely sprayed red stars on alleyway walls. Red and gold flags waved in the air and hung from neighborhood houses, if only for a little time. The hills have eyes, the walls have ears - and the body parts are all from Suslov.\n\nSince our campaign against Gumilyov and the right began, a surge in communist activity has been present throughout the streets of Komi. Taking the opportunity and striking our blindspots, they have begun their own campaign against the right, looking to finish them off for good. While this is ostensibly good for us, the left will have a new target when Gumilyov is gone for good: us. We must make preparations and plans for this scenario, before we are caught off guard by a powerful, and influential, red army."
 NIK_believe_in_svetlana_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the only politicians that may be able to crush Gumilyov, Svetlana Stalina is one of our most important assets in the battle against the radicals. Not only do her speeches inspire our politicians, but also motivates our supporters, making them even more willing to fight for their country.\n\nSvetlana is the way forward, and if we are to crush the right (and the left) and bring order to Komi, she must carry the torch of democracy and the flame of the will of the people - of which we have full confidence in her. It is up to us to follow her examples, and stabilize the Republic for good."
 NIK_the_interlude_desc:0 "It seems, if only for a temporary period of time, that things have finally calmed down again. The plotters have retreated out of the public eye, most likely so that they can continue plotting in the dark. The streets have become tranquil, and the legislative sessions are less and less chaotic.\n\nThere is, however, a reason for this calm. Soon, democracy will once again be tested in elections throughout the Komi Republic. Each and every faction that wishes to see their leader in power now must plan and consolidate, calculating public support and paramilitary control of areas. The time of movement has ended. The time of strategizing has begun."

 NIK_the_1963_assembly_desc:0 "The time has come. Every five years, a new President is elected, and every two years, a new National Assembly. This election is no different than every other election: a high-stakes contest where each candidate for the head of the house campaigns to control the Republic, and everything valuable within.\n\nAs per tradition, it is now time to choose our candidate for figurehead of the democratic coalition. Each of the three candidates - Voznesensky, Kosygin, and Stalina - will express their positions and why, exactly, they deserve to be the leader of the democrats - and the people. After, we will select a Presidential candidate, who, hopefully, will be the best choice for our nation."
 NIK_election_day_preparations_desc:0 "An election is not something that can be organized on the spot, even if the radicals believe otherwise. We must now begin the process of readying the poll booths, sending out fliers, organizing locations, and more of the standard procedure that bores our legislators to no end.\n\nAs usual, we will call up ready volunteers to do their duty to democracy, and do these tasks for us. And in all of this, of course, we must also be aware of the radicals, for their idea of 'preparations' is something much more sinister..."
 NIK_ensure_internal_stability_desc:0 "In recent days, it has been reported that our party is a "mess" in certain areas, such as the fact that debates over sometimes trivial things can run hot and wild between our Deputies, as well as growing factionalism and refusal of cooperation between party members. While, normally, this has been allowed under the perpetrator's defense of "freedom of opinion and expression", the upcoming election is one of the most critical in our history, and the democratic party cannot permit these problems any longer.\n\nThrough distinct methods, we will ensure that everyone sits down and shuts up - united as one party. No longer shall the chamber erupt into argument every other speech, and no longer shall we tolerate the cracks between our wings. We will be as one, together - we must be, for the radicals shall come as one as well."
 NIK_calculate_the_bombing_intervals_desc:0 "Each and every week brings hellish armageddon down upon our lands, as the Nazi bastards rain down their bombs upon the people of Russia. New orphans are created every day, and hospitals always fill to the brim for days after - especially Tuesdays, for that's when they all come.\n\nThe Germans are as predictable as they are evil. It is no coincidence that the bombs always rain down at specific times and more on certain days than others, that their Wehrmacht seeks to enjoy the coffee breaks at their designated hours and days and not any other. They will not stop our "little" democracy. All it takes is a little calculation, and any interruption of the election will no longer come from the air."
 NIK_protect_the_people_desc:0 "A person should always feel safe in their own home - whether from the inside or out. While they do not dare touch our cities, bandits and thugs have been known to roam the countryside, seeking to rob and maim to their heart's content. In addition, the German bombings have been a constant source of casualties, blasting apart anyone that is unfortunate enough to be near their dastardly weapons.\n\nPeople cannot vote if they are busy with other things, such as surviving. Therefore, we must embark on a program to cleanse the bandits from our countryside, guard our borders from any foreign incursions, and defend ourselves from the air raids. Only then shall democracy flourish."
 NIK_watch_the_radicals_desc:0 "The radicals have never believed in the democratic process, even if they say otherwise. While they have been rather quiet in the days leading up to the election, it is always possible they may come out of the shadows at any time. The chessmasters on either side still have aces up their sleeves, and there is no telling exactly what they have in store.\n\nObservation of the paramilitaries are necessary, and any left-wing or right-wing activity will be snuffed out and found. If they have any "funny tricks" they wish to play, we will know - and we will fight back."
 NIK_something_wicked_this_way_comes_desc:0 "Months of rigorous preparation. Days of campaigning. Enjoy it or dread it, participate in it or flee from it - the election comes all the same.\n\nNow comes the trial of democracy, and the ruling with it. Each and every preparation that we have done for this event will now either pay off or let us down. This critical election decides our fate, and the future. Some doubt our chances, and others wish us dead, but no matter what happens - democracy will always prevail in the end."

 NIK_the_affairs_of_the_legislature_desc:0 "As much as our detractors enjoy condemning our Republic for its excess of political intrigue and the occasional bout of violence, there is more to Komi than scheming and intriguing. The policies of the National Assembly, while bitterly contested, as all things are, are a critical element for the thousands of people who are affected by the government's machinations each year. Opening the National Assembly for the year, appointing new party whips, and ensuring that everything functions as normal shall ensure that the functions of the Republic's institutions are as strong as ever.\n\nAdditionally, this will give us the opportunity to cut through precedent and tradition, changing long-standing laws and improving life for the multitudes of citizens of the Republic. Through the tactful exercise of state power, backed by the people, anything becomes possible."
 NIK_bill_the_1962_budget_desc:0 "The 1962 budget of the Republic is a critical document providing a comprehensive list of appropriations for each and every program administered by the government of Komi. However, even with the ruling coalition's dominance of the National Assembly, its passage is not entirely guaranteed. Historically, compromise has been necessary to pass budgets, as every party within the coalition has different ideas on what should be funded.\n\nThe budget, thusly, has become an exercise in pork-barrel spending, with Deputies given appropriations for pet projects to keep them loyal. With the increasing unpopularity of President Voznesensky, however, the National Assembly could, possibly, not be quelled by the usual tricks. Numerous advisors and allies to the President have hinted to him that the usual methods of getting the government on his side will be much less effective during this term, and additional means may be necessary to ensure that the Republic gets what it needs in terms of funding."
 NIK_bill_the_infrastructure_repair_bill_desc:0 "While the Republic has a department of transportation that handles repairs to infrastructure and replacements to damaged watercraft and transport vehicles, the department has constantly delivered complaints about how its funding is insufficient to deal with every issue that it currently faces. A new bill has been proposed to the National Assembly to pass through a special appropriation for the department of transportation, which is to be dedicated specifically to providing aid to their infrastructure repair division.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the bill are undecided, specifically, labor laws and the exact source for the funds which are to be dedicated. These matters must be decided on in the National Assembly before the bill is to pass."
 NIK_bill_the_mandated_minority_representation_bill_desc:0 "There lies a deeply concerning trend throughout our Republic of inequality in the National Assembly. The majority of the Deputies are Russian, with an extreme minority of the National Assembly made up of the peoples that the Republic bears the name of - the Komi. The proposed bill, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina's PSD, makes a stand for a certain quota of minority representation, with new districts drawn to ensure more minorities are sent to the National Assembly, and the rich cultures of the Komi can be protected from a lack of representation.\n\nUnusually, Stalina and the Left have aligned on this matter, with a large contingent of the Voznesentsi, the PSD, and the Communists supporting this measure. The fate of the bill seems to rest on the groups that can be rallied to support or oppose it - a more moderate bill could gain the support of more of the center, who are concerned about the political ramifications of mandated representation, and marginalize the left."
 NIK_bill_the_defense_of_the_republic_bill_desc:0 "The Komi Republican Army is a formidable force in the Russian wastes, but has its own set of problems - namely, its small size. Due to our small population and necessarily inefficient census system, the Army doesn't get quite as much manpower as it needs from our current conscription policies. Several solutions have been raised in the National Assembly to address this issue and defend the Republic from hostile neighbors.\n\nWhile the official line of the ruling coalition is to increase the conscription period from one to two years, the Left has proposed an addendum - a loosening of the laws that ban certain people from volunteering for military service, due to participation in certain political organizations. While this is a drastic measure, it could assist the Republic in getting the manpower it needs. The solution, as always, will be decided in the National Assembly."
 NIK_bill_the_equal_zoning_bill_desc:0 "Redistricting is a concern that has long affected many elements within our Republic, from the disenfranchised refugees on the peripheries of our cities, to the politicians attempting to organize their re-elections. The process is infamously arduous within Komi and Syktyvkar specifically, thanks to the bombings and high volume of population transfers thanks to refugees and our lack of resources to run accurate censuses.\n\nThis, naturally, has lead to an environment in which more or less any sort of population distribution can be constructed and made to look official, without cooking the books too much. Behind the curtain, the President has spoken to several Deputies on the redistricting board - giving a favor to certain politicians to make them unassailable in their districts could be just the 'incentive' they need to throw more of their support behind the government's initiatives."
 NIK_bill_the_municipal_pacification_bill_desc:0 "The paramilitary situation has been said to be getting completely uncontrollable, with a general uptick in overall violence over time. Several politicians in the National Assembly, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina and Alexei Kosygin, leaders of the democratic centre, have proposed a rather drastic bill, one that has been said to increase police powers within 'problem areas' of the Republic to levels not seen since the days of Bukharin. While many politicians in the National Assembly have railed against the bill, calling it a tyrannical government overreach, and a naked attempt at shutting down political opposition to the current ruling parties, one can also argue that this opposition is just an attempt to prevent these politicians' illicit sources of assistance from being persecuted. Whether they like it or not, the bill will come up to vote, and it will all come down to the democratic process."

 NIK_countercoup_democrats_coup_desc:0 "When the Republic was founded, it was the goal of the governing parties to keep violence out of Komi's political system. Though noble, this goal was a terrible failure in practice, to the point that the defenders of democracy have had to use the same weapon as its enemies: a military coup.\n\nNow that Komi's democracy has been saved from the brink of death, it is the military's responsibility to safeguard it, lest it be lost again and irreversibly. We must be ever vigilant; never again can extremism be allowed to threaten our liberties. Only after we have weathered the storm can the Republic return to a situation approaching normal."
 NIK_countercoup_defend_democracy_desc:0 "It was nearly lost, but the people of Komi have retaken their democracy from the clutches of an extremist putsch. The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public.\n\nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy. Media campaigns against extremism of both the right and the left and a hunt for the anti-democratic forces in our midst are a must if we want to fully restore confidence in the liberal system."
 NIK_countercoup_expel_the_radicals_desc:0 "While the political leadership stakes out its course, most of the day-to-day runnings of the republic is handled by the bureaucracy, the police and the army. We must ensure these vital institutions can't be subverted by radicals. We will thoroughly vet our institutions and get rid of everyone with dangerous radical sympathies."
 NIK_countercoup_every_last_resource_desc:0 "We are at a precipice. Our beloved republic is at real threat of being destroyed by subversive forces. To save it, we must be prepared to throw everything we have into the struggle. All our resources and materiel must be put to use. Every last rouble invested. Every loyal citizen must be mobilized. We can't afford to keep anything in reserve. For the good of the republic!"
 NIK_countercoup_emergency_rule_desc:0 "The greatest triumph of our republic has been to end arbitrary "frontier justice" and give its people a dependable, predictable justice system to protect their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the radicals still have sympathizers in our society, sympathizers who will abuse these freedoms to obstruct our efforts to restabilize the republic. We are forced to suspend, for the time being, some of our most cherished rights. The radicals have given us no other option."
 NIK_countercoup_restore_order_desc:0 "The Republican Army failed in its duty when it allowed our Republic to fall to radical forces. While loyal officers have been vital in striking back, our forces are still scattered and demoralized. This state of affairs can't be allowed to continue. Our enemies are rallying their forces, and the struggle for our home is far from over. We need our army back.\n\nWe must rally our soldiers. We must remind them of their duty. The army will restore its honor by crushing the nascent insurgency."
 NIK_countercoup_our_loyal_sympathizers_desc:0 "A large majority of our citizens support the republic and believe in its founding principles. Recent events have shown, however, that this majority is prone to inaction in the face of attacks by internal, radical forces. We must restore their confidence and teach them principles and tactics of resistance and mass action, so that they will resist attempts to subvert their rights and freedoms and do their part to defend the republic in the future."
 NIK_countercoup_paralyze_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Several political movements have organized their membership into paramilitaries. Previously tolerated to maintain stability, it is now abundantly clear the practice needs to end. The coup-makers leaned heavily on their armed support, but even the notionally loyal groupings proved unreliable, acting more as agents of chaos than allies. We will issue a demand for all such groupings to stand down and demobilize permanently. Paramilitaries which refuse will be subject to arrests and forced disarmament. Peace in the republic requires it."
 NIK_countercoup_restore_the_quiet_desc:0 "The recent instability and fighting in the republic has wreaked havoc on the economy and the day-to-day rhythm of civilian life. While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 NIK_countercoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc:0 "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

 NIK_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc:0 "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 NIK_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc:0 "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 NIK_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc:0 "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 NIK_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc:0 "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 NIK_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc:0 "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communist and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 NIK_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc:0 "Left unsaid in the communist and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the republic. The communists and fascists fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 NIK_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc:0 "As the fascist and communist plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 NIK_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc:0 "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's republican army is completely compromised; its officer corp riddled with Suslov plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 NIK_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc:0 "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 NIK_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc:0 "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_saved_desc:0 "Rejoice, citizen, for the republic has been saved!\n\nIt has taken our government everything to prevent our young nation's fall into extremism. But now that the dust has begun settling, our political system has been repaired and we stand united to face against the wider world. Soldiers and leaders that had once only been concerned with surviving just another week are now free to turn toward the rest of Russia. With the end of the Anarchy, many factions will no doubt attempt to impose their control on the lands of the former Soviet Union. Our Republic must stand ready to expand outward in order to crush extremists and find new allies for our fledgling nation.\n\nWe have crushed the fascists and communists in Komi, and this experience shall serve us well!"
 NIK_demexpansion_assemble_the_armories_desc:0 "With the end of political violence, many armories and weapon caches that were under the control of extremists elements are now open to access. It will take some time to count everything, but already the available rifles and support equipment can be pressed into service to help equip the Republican Army further.\n\nSecuring as many weapons as possible will also help us douse the embers of political extremism. The days of private militias holding onto weapon stockpiles are finally coming to an end. From now on, the government shall decide who has access to military hardware, and that's that."
 NIK_demexpansion_infrastructure_programs_desc:0 "Now that a map of Syktyvkar no longer resemble a chess board of districts held by a protean mass of paramilitaries of varying allegiance, we are free to roll out unified infrastructure plans. Places where the government has not dared send officials in ages can finally be assessed, improved and perhaps even taxed.\n\nThe least controversial move will first be to improve the infrastructure in and around Syktyvkar. Crumbling roads and buildings do not inspire much hope that the government is looking after the common man. Nor are they much help to an economy attempting to climb out of years of stagnation."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_army_of_the_republic_desc:0 "Komi has always had, on paper at least, a strong army. Since its inception the republic has remained free from foreign encroachment by the quantity of soldiers in the field.\n\nThis has not always been evident to the man in Syktyvkar's streets. Riddled with corruption and factionalism, with entire units either underpaid or overpaid to ensure political reliability, the army of the republic has always been perceived as a right mess. A significant fraction of its total strength is composed of militias and men outside the regular command structure, fighting only in dire emergencies. Now that the Republic desires to expand outward, a more regular state of affairs is needed. Two proposals have been thought up on the army reforms, and it's important to decide rapidly on which one the republic prefers."
 NIK_demexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "The first faction proposes scrapping every militia and integrating their men into the regular army. This will be a daunting undertaking, stretching our current army structure to the breaking point. Countless militiamen will have to be screened for political extremism, and those that don't make the cut will no doubt be angry at losing their job and weapons.\n\nCompleting the reform will take time and effort. But as the WRRF has demonstrated in the fifties, a regular army can achieve miracles when properly organized. The republic must end the militias if it is to be safe internally and externally."
 NIK_demexpansion_elevate_gifted_officers_desc:0 "Dozens of smart and dedicated men have joined our army from their former militias. In Komi's hyper competitive period of political instability, one did not rise to the top without a good head on their shoulders.\n\nThe integration of these men has done much to soothe the concern of former militiamen about more purges and arrests of the militias. It has also brought us a treasure of institutional experience. Veterans that have fought in the West Russian War, or helped defend Komi as auxiliary militias are now pouring into our army and helping redefine its doctrines for the better."
 NIK_demexpansion_keep_the_militia_structure_desc:0 "The other approach to reforming our army is to preserve the militia structure. Having armed men outside of the army is a concern for many reasons: some worry about disloyalty from the militias, others point to the dangers of a non-standardized fighting force, or of amateur soldiers breaking at the first sign of danger.\n\nTo others, the militias are a perfectly valid part of Komi's arsenal. They provide large amount of volunteers to defend the rear of the Republican Army; they provide an easy way to train up new soldiers that might one day join the regular army; they show that our reformed government bears no ill will toward its past enemies as all of Komi turns toward the future. Preserving the militias can thus be an essential part of the republic's security policy."
 NIK_demexpansion_popular_mobilization_desc:0 "Our decision to preserve the militia has made us a lot of friends. Militia commanders of all stripes have decided to repay our trust with a call to mass mobilization. Areas of the city long held by the militias with inhabitants that disdained the republic's officials are now beginning to offer their help. A tide of new recruits to the militias and army has begun cropping up. All that is now needed is to train and equip the brave patriots willing to fight for their country!"
 NIK_demexpansion_mission_to_vologda_desc:0 "To the west, general Ivanov maintains a careful position of armed neutrality in Vologda. In the aftermath of the Front's collapse, the good general decided that spilling the blood of Russian civilians for ideological squabbles was simply not worth it. Vologda has kept up cordial, if bemused relations with Komi's unstable republic. The western junta has long appreciated Komi's policy of welcoming all, while disliking the resulting political violence.\n\nWith a newly minted democratic government standing proud, it might be time to revisit the relationship. Komi and Vologda both face external threats from the Front and from southern regimes. A diplomatic mission has thus been sent to Vologda to offer a treaty of peace and friendship between both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_an_alliance_for_peace_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, our President is scheduled to meet with Vologda's representatives to sign a treaty of peace and friendship. Soldiers and citizens of both side cheered the news that their leadership plans to sign one of the first peaceful reunification of the Russian nation.\n\nMuch remain to be done, beyond this ceremony. The depth of the military alliance, as well as its implication on economical and political matters remain to be seen. But throughout both nations, there is nigh universal agreement that mutual friendship and assistance is the best way forward."
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_economic_ties_desc:0 "As Vologda and Komi get closer, their respective economies continue rising from the decade of bombing and warlordism. Trade links that had already been significant during the Anarchy are being strengthened by the day. In this light, it is essential for official trade policies to be established between the two allies.\n\nStrategic industries from both side will be integrated, helping both Komi and Vologda to increase their military readiness. Joint investment schemes have also been discussed to help lift up the civilian economy of both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_freedom_of_movement_desc:0 "The frontier between warlords in Russia is often more of a theoretical concept, consisting of a long range of military checkpoints and demilitarized zones plagued by bandits or lawlessness. While in theory there had been no law prohibiting movement between Vologda and Komi, in practice doing so required several levels of military approvals for private citizens. Traders have long been used to carrying their stack of documents at military checkpoints.\n\nA new treaty is in the work, providing legal rights to Vologda and Komi's citizens to cross the border unimpeded. This will no doubt help friendship and partnership blossom among our nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_mutual_defense_desc:0 "While Vologda might not be totally ready to join any of our future wars of liberation, their generals have agreed to strong mutual defense treaties. In the event of an attack on one side, the other is expected to declare war on the invaders. This defensive alliance will free up much needed resources for Komi's Republican army. Contingency plans for defensive wars will no longer use the hypothesis that the Komi-Vologda frontier requires constant military defense. Likewise, the Vologdan army will be free to tend to its own business, confident in the safety of its eastern flank."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_alone_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, the republic's reformed army will be deployed in a pre-planned military exercise. The Vologdan high command has been dutifully noted of this; rumors on the street in both capital is that while cordial relations will continue, Komi's government has little interest in demilitarizing the border between both nations after receiving Vologda's refusal of an alliance.\n\nWhile disappointed, analysts inside of Komi's government are not too shaken about Vologda's refusal. It is likely that the Vologdan generals would have refused to help Komi in its offensive wars of liberation in Western Russia. In the end, the republic would have always had to fight alone for the freedom and safety of all Russians."
 NIK_demexpansion_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "The unfortunate refusal by Vologda of friendship means that the republic, as always, is surrounded by enemies on all sides. Military planners have thus begun preparing supply and communication lines in the event of any invasion by hostile powers. Plans that had been drafted in the event of Vologdan friendship are scrapped, replaced by scenarios where a hostile western army attacks the republic while it is busy elsewhere.\n\nThe republic stands vigilant, and sleeps with one eye open."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Going at it alone will require ever more troops in the army. A new call for expanded emergency conscription is being prepared. Our government will explain to every citizen the reason for our renewed conscription policy, and the importance of manning every frontier of the republic. New recruits will be able to free up experienced men for frontier duty, and eventually these veterans will lead the spearhead of our reclamation wars."
 NIK_demexpansion_watch_and_wait_desc:0 "Our frontiers have never been better defended. As troops settle into their new assignments, officers on the border have been given secret tasks. The best and brightest men of each formation are to run reconnaissance patrols in the demilitarized border zones between us and our rivals. The men are to probe enemy fortifications, observe enemy patrol frequency and destinations, and do their best to assess weak points in enemy lines. This information will be crucial once we go on the offensive."

To the north lie the remnants of the Soviet Union, haunted by its failures and angry at our independence. Even as we speak, the northern Red Army plots our undoing!\n\nTo the south and east, things are not any better. Deluded tsarist remnants wish to turn back the clock and reimpose the shackles of autocracy on our free citizens. In this project they resemble our eastern neighbors. In Gayny, a theocracy blames Russia's woes not on the evil of German fascism, but on the anger of an unforgiving God. These madmen believe that only by subjugating Russia to the church's whim will the people be saved.\n\nThe republic rejects this madness! It is not a cabal of communist or tsarist military officers that can free Russia. Nor can its salvation come from subservience to crazed monks. The only power strong enough to free Russia is its citizens. We must be on our guards!"\n Extract from President [NIK.GetLeader]'s speech to the republic."

The army's commanders have presented to the civilian authorities several military plans as well as new doctrinal recommendations.

The military plans provide a wide range of military campaigns against neighboring threats to the republic's safety.\n\nIt is likely that the civilian leadership will bring a few recommendations of its own.

The largest remnant of the Soviet government, the Front fought valiantly in the fifties and almost managed to break the Wehrmacht's spine. When the tide turned, Syktyvkar was to be the Front's fallback capital. Their evacuation pushed further north by the Luftwaffe, the remnants of the Red Army have spent a decade licking their wounds and plotting a comeback.\n\nThe communist's intention against Komi are crystal clear. Arkhangelsk sees us as as nothing more than illegitimate separatist rebels. Our recent suppression of the far left has not improved our reputation with them. Already the Red Army plants its invasion of the south. If our republic is to survive, we must prepare to take the war to them. This will be a titanic struggle, for most of the professional soldiers and industry in western Russia are in the Front's hands. We must prepare!"
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_syktyvkar_desc:0 "Syktyvkar is our greatest city, and one of our greatest assets. We cannot afford to lose its population and industries to the communists, or anyone else.\n\nThe Vychegda river's bank have been chosen as the ultimate defensive position, with forward positions on the far side of the river to delay any attack from the north east. Each crossing has been turned into a miniature, self sufficient fortress. The city's districts themselves are also being fortified, with many civilians having a sentiment of deja-vu as their hometown is once more prepared for violent conflict. Each military command and government office in the city has been given several fall back positions, to ensure continuity of government in the events that parts of the city are overrun. In the suburbs, industrial positions have been fortified, with factory workers and nearby inhabitants trained as emergency firefighters.\n\nSyktyvkar shall be one great fortress, a bulwark against tyranny no matter its source!"
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The Vychegda river snake along most of our border with the Front. Any direct assault on Syvtykar is likely to require forces on the southern shore of the river, especially if the Red Army attempts to use its tank corps to surround the city. Using the river as a first line of defense is thus a logical step in our preparations for conflict.\n\nA line of machine gun positions and barbed wire on our side of the river will inflict tremendous casualties on any attacking force. Further inland, bunkers and forts will hold mobile troops and artillery able to be redeployed to push any beachhead back into the water. The river will run red with our enemy's blood!"
 NIK_demexpansion_secondary_redoubt_preparation_desc:0 "A defensive line is only worth as much time as it buys for its defenders. Once breached, a series of fortifications can easily be surrounded, trapping its garrison. It is thus important to build reinforced fall back position further south where our men can continue to fight in the event of a breach of the Vychegda line. The Front's commanders will thus have to decide between overrunning every defensive line, or attempt to capture Syktyvkar with exposed flank. Thus, our secondary positions serve crucial roles in defensive as well as in counter-offensive plans."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_red_desc:0 "Our northern frontier is now heavily defended against any Communist violence. Any Red Army aggression will cost it dearly in terms of manpower and materiel. Once the invaders have been repelled, our commanders will be free to follow the broken formations north and attempt our own crossing of the Vychegda river.\n\nWar with the front will be far from easy. But our position is secure. The Front must either defeat us, Vologda or Gayny if they are to expand in western Russia. The communists are bound to run out of patience and make a tactical mistake in their hope of breaking out of the arctic. We've only got to wait long enough to exploit their desperation. And this combination of preparation and strategic patience forms the core of War Plan Red."
 NIK_demexpansion_against_the_monarchists_desc:0 "To the south, monarchists have recreated a miniature Russian Empire in Vyatka. Perhaps it was this later-day white army's intention to cloak itself in history. What better, after all, than a new Romanov tsar to end these modern time of troubles? This historical allusion has not provided much humor to Komi's military thinkers as the monarchist have raised a large army of rabble to this end. The monarchists do not field an army as potent as the Front. But their troops are on the march, and an invasion of Komi is inevitable.\n\nThe Republican Army's generals have thus been preparing both defensive and offensive plans against Vyatka. If the monarchists attack, our soldiers would be more than ready to repel them. If we judge it is time to end their monarchist nonsense, our men will be equally prepared to launch an invasion of the south. The white army's day are numbered."
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_vilegodsk_desc:0 "Our border with the monarchists follow the Vyatka river. While smaller than the Vychedga river to the north, the Vyatka rivers offers a natural barrier against the whites. The largest city on the river's north bank is Slobodskoy, in south western Komi. From its origin as a small village, the area has seen a population boom as refugees have settled into the young republic and a large military garrison has been established on the southern border. Now the garrison town is being fortified. Slobodskoy will be an important staging point for an invasion of the monarchists, or for any defensive operation along the river's bank. As such, it's a primary necessity to see the city protected from all sides."
 NIK_demexpansion_staff_the_tundra_desc:0 "Winter Operations are an essential part of the toolkit of any Russian commander worth his salt. Right now our men usually winter inside garrison town, with less than a third of our men used to cold weather deployments in rough outposts. Our new deployment scheme will seek to remedy this by giving every rank of soldier training in the outdoors. Once the soldiers are used to operating in winter as in summer, they will possess the capacity to fight whatever the season."
 NIK_demexpansion_hidden_positions_desc:0 "The monarchists will no doubt attempt to cross the Vyatka river and gain a foothold in southern Komi before attempting to march onto our capital. In the events of such a breach of our southern defensive line, possessing hidden cards to play would be to the republic's advantage.\n\nWork has thus been planned for a line of secondary hidden fortification. This network of camouflaged bunker will shelter our troops if they feel the need to fall back to the interior. They will also let us strike at the flank of any army marching on Syktyvkar."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_white_desc:0 "While much of our preparation for Plan White has been defensive in nature, our commanders have still given much thought to the best way to crack the monarchist's defensive lines.\n\nThe monarchists have lost no time industrializing, and the Izhevsk arms factory to the south has equipped their conscripts with good weapons. The most obvious path to victory would be the capture of Kudymkar and its surroundings, the one stretch of the border not covered by rivers. The enemy is likely to know this, and defend the area vigorously. The alternatives are costly attempts at crossing the fortified rivers. Once in enemy territory, sieging the enemy capital of Vyatka to separate its defenders from southern industry would likely be a great tactical victory. Secondary target include Izhevsk and Krasnokamsk. Our men must be ready to pay the price for ultimate victory over the monarchist threat!"

It is very likely that our so-called "godless republic" is next on the monk's chopping block. We must thus prepare contingency plans for a conflict with them.\n\nMilitary authorities have begun reinforcing the eastern regions while our republic's priests and politicians have made joint speeches denouncing Gayny as a mere doomsday cult.\n\nNo matter their goals, these mad monks shall not be given a chance to sabotage our efforts."

To face a two or three front war at a critical moment would certainly doom the republic.\n\nInvading the theocracy will be no cakewalk, as fanatical soldiers will follow their religious leaders into battle. The Republican Army must prevail, and rapidly, lest it gets bogged down in a war it cannot afford."
 NIK_demexpansion_extend_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The long Vychegda river is already at the core of preparations made against the Western Russia Revolutionary Front, or Plan Red. The waterway also snakes its way along the Komi-Gayny frontier. Fortifying it would be a cheap way to deter aggression from the angry theocracy. Were the worst to happen and the monks to attack us while we are busy elsewhere, the lengthened Vychedga line would make it easy for small deployments of border troops to repel the attackers until reinforcements are available for a counter-attack. Thus, the generals have approved additional fortification of the area."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_black_desc:0 "It is always a troubling sight for our eastern troops to see their opposite number dig trenches and prepare staging grounds across the Vychegda rivers. The monk and their warriors are no raging peasant mob, but a well organized militia that is preparing for a conventional conflict crossed with a holy crusade.\n\nBut no amount of preparation can make an under-industrialized army break a reinforced trench line, as the first world war shows.

The Vologdan government could collapse, or turn hostile, or fall to invasion. As a result it is good to have some contingency planning for a western war. The usual invasion plans have been drawn up by our commanders, as have a set of recommendations for improved border defences.\n\nNo matter how the Vologdan government feels about us, it will understand our reasoning. In fact, it wouldn't surprise us if they did the very same thing."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_western_line_desc:0 "Particularly important to our defensive problem with Vologda is that our nation share a long border uninterrupted by rivers or wetlands. It will thus be costly but important to see a long line of bunkers, trenches, fortified positions and garrisons created. In the event of fighting in our western lands, these new fortifications, combined with existing or upcoming military outposts designed for plans Red and White will serve as a bulwark for our wester soldiers."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_border_patrols_desc:0 "Soldiers that know a battlefield well can often win surprising victories through deception and quick thinking. The troops on the western frontier have seen their border patrol efforts expanded. Many of our men that had spent their life in Syktyvkar are discovering the countryside in and around the Vologdan border. While a few grumble at the effort, most seem happy at the opportunity to trade barracks life for extended camping trip around the wester territories."

It is difficult to gain further military intel without offending the Vologdan government with our espionnage.

Our enemies held great amount of industrial equipment, war supplies and population. Already the republic has gone from one of the weakest factions to one of the powerhouses of western Russia. If the soldiers have been allowed some rest, our poor bureaucrats are working triple overtime to somehow integrate mountains of resources into a system not designed for population and territory of that magnitude.

The men of Vologda are famous for their opposition to wars of aggression against fellow Russian citizens, and now we ask them for help in our grim unification of western Russia.

Propaganda depicting Vologda as a tyrannical regime will likely ring hollow to our men... Yet, military analysts predict the campaign's success.

 NIK_demexpansion_ensure_industrial_preparedness_desc:0 "Building an industrial economy from the ground up using factories taken over in wars of conflict is not a precise science. Many factories that fall in our hands are geared to produce the same things as other industrial areas in our possession. Russian warlords usually function on an autarkic production system that sees everything crafted locally. Conversely, there are many goods that are produced nowhere, as the divided Russian territories did not possess an economy large enough for things beyond basic military weapons.\n\nAll this is beginning to change as we develop an integrated industrial policy prepared for a wide range of scenarios and needs. Once rare items are now being produced in large quantities as the republic synergizes its various economic sectors to prevent any future penury of goods. Entire supply chains of complex outputs are reappearing in western Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_secure_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Operational integrity seeks to gather men, methods of doing and materiel into one unified whole. Mechanized tactics cannot exist without supply and logistical regiments. Once in the field, tanks and vehicles are vulnerable to aerial attacks, requiring aerial support of our own. The deployment of costly vehicles and their experienced operators relies on the assumption that neither men nor materiel are in danger of destruction. Thus any deployment also requires an intel corps.\n\nOperational integrity is thus a complex system of simple parts brought together to perform critical military tasks. Our soldiers and generals have integrated every lessons of past conflicts into a new way of doing things. Long before a tank rolls out of our new factories, its purpose is well understood by our military. Our enemy shall learn to fear this oneness of purpose and action."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_brown_desc:0 "What more is there to say concerning General Vlasov and his men? The death warrant of every single man of the ROA was signed with the blood of countless Russian soldiers killed on the order of the German Fascists. It is a mystery how Vlasov can keep talking of 'Russian Liberation' when he and his acolytes have ensured that the suffering of the Russian people would last another miserable decade of steel and death.\n\nIt would not be accurate to depict the men of the ROA as spineless cowards, for they've shown courage time and time again when using their german training to take on impossible odds in the West Russian War. All we can hope is that these pigs in human form feel at least some fear at their upcoming judgement. The liberation of Samara must begin."
 NIK_demexpansion_consolidating_the_republic_desc:0 "While military and diplomatic conquest of the shattered lands of Western Russia is all well and good, we must not forget the greater civilian and bureaucratic apparatus that we must establish over our new lands. With West Russia now under our control, the time has come to begin the consolidation of the Republic - running censuses, ensuring that our institutions can handle our new populations, setting up supply lines, installing local leaders, and the thousand other tasks needed to set up a sustainable state."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_centered_capital_desc:0 "Syktyvkar, the capital of our estimable Republic, has served us well, and has a storied history as the most important city we possessed, in the dark days of our origin. However, a dilemma faces the government, one that is a simple manner of infrastructure, housing, and facilities with which to administer all of West Russia. The cities of Vyatka and Samara, now that they are cleansed of Tsarist and fascist influence, respectably, have both been submitted as possible new capitals for the Republic. While Syktyvkar is well loved, the time may very well have come to move to more grandiose housing."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_west_russian_census_desc:0 "Russia is a big place, and while we do not own anywhere near all of it, our Republic occupies a significant portion of the former Soviet Union's landmass. The teeming multitudes of people across our lands have not yet been counted or audited - in order for our democratic institutions and basic social services to have a chance of working at all, we must make a detailed census of our population. Census-takers, many accompanied by armed police, will be dispatched from regional centers in order to alleviate this issue immediately."
 NIK_demexpansion_faith_in_democracy_desc:0 "Outside of the abortive Republic under Kerensky, Russia has never known true democracy of the sort that we wish to deliver to its people. Understandably and expectedly, the people are nervous and confused - as polling booths are elected, many peasants stay home or attempt to submit blank ballots, fearful of the watchful eyes of the no-longer-existent NKVD.\n\nThis will not do - we must enact a comprehensive program of democratic education, as well as communicate to the people well and truly what our goals and principles are. Democracy must stem from the people, and it may never bloom if the people do not have faith."
 NIK_demexpansion_activate_the_factories_desc:0 "Across the Republic, factories and other works of technological skill lie unused and unrepaired, for lack of expertise needed to run them. We must restore them at once, and soon, the people of the Republic will be able to enjoy the prosperity that an industrialized economy shall bring. Cars once more shall roam the roads of Russia, our army shall be furnished with matching rifles, and our grand cities' streets shall be lit with constant, incandescent electrical glow."
 NIK_demexpansion_get_the_peasants_on_board_desc:0 "The final and most crucial part of establishing the new Republic is securing our stores of food, and setting up systems through which the peasantry may be able to once more prosper. For years, many within the Republic, especially those in the frozen North, have struggled under the weight of food insecurity, poor soil, and bad weather. With the fertile lands of the south once more attained, we are now free to organize a better arrangement between the peasantry and our workers, ensuring that all may prosper and be nourished by the Republic's golden wheat."
 NIK_demexpansion_meet_with_the_finns_desc:0 "A final piece of land lies out of our control in western Russia. In Onega the Finnish government has propped up an army of Russian conscript as a desperate buffer zone between them and the WRRF. While the fear of invasion by the WRRF's brand of military communism is a little understandable, the cowardly Finns have forced Russian men to fight, lest their families be in danger.\n\nThe people of Onega deserves better than servitude at the hands of the Finns. And the Finn shall receive a lesson that the Germans would do well to pay heed to: no one enslaves the people of Russia without fearing consequences down the line. We will prepare a diplomatic party. They will have only one warning."
 
 NIK_demexpansion_restoring_order_desc:0 "The Republic has managed to sail out of the most dangerous sea. Yet we are not out of the storm yet, for internal enemies still roam within our borders just as we march to war with external rivals.\n\nCaution is the order of the day. Anti-democratic extremists have been severely hurt by repeated losses. As we set out to destroy our regional rivals, we must also keep up the pressure on domestic threats. For this task we can thankfully bring to bear the full legal apparatus. Police officers, judges as well as lawmakers can work in coordination to stamp out poisonous elements.\n\nFinal victory at home is within our grasp. Once its rears are secured, the army of the Republic will be able to begin its march to restore democracy to all of Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_root_out_paramilitary_commanders_desc:0 "The army of the Republic has long been a pit of snakes. Political extremism within the officer corp was impossible to root out without fatally weakening the democratic government's grip on power. Left to their own devices, fascist and communist officers were free to aid anti-democratic street gangs. Some did so by propagating their doctrines to rank and files of the army; others used their tactical training to lead street gangs from the shadows; finally some served in the training of paramilitaries.\n\nWith the far right and far left waning in influence, we can finally remove from service officers and commanders who carry the taint of extremism. The loss of experienced personnel will be worth it as the central government's domestic position is reinforced and the soldiers march out with unity of purpose to face the enemy."
 NIK_demexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc:0 "Many ordinary citizens cooperated with extremists, whether out of greed or ideological zealotry. Now that the judicial system is firmly under our control and that extremists in politics have been shackled, we can crack down with impunity on collaborators and fellow travellers.\n\nThe Republic must cast a wide net to arrest all those who contributed to the government's enemies. Those who broke no laws will be intimidated into taking plea-deals. Personal finances will be audited. We shall process methodically until all are guilty, or all have betrayed their former collaborators.\n\nThere shall be justice for the victims of political violence!"
 NIK_demexpansion_make_an_example_desc:0 "The Republic does not condemn its citizens to death lightly. However, there must be retribution for those who have conspired to end the nation's freedom and tolerance. Those who have infected Syktyvkar with violence must face justice. Those who have robbed their fellow citizens, those who have injured the innocents, those who have killed under the influence of extremism, all must see their sins weighed and face the risk of the greatest retribution of all.\n\nThe worst of the worst shall be executed. We do not have pity for traitors, and their deaths will hopefully inspire fear among their surviving allies. The Republic's justice is eternal. And its vengeance shall not spare the wicked."
 NIK_demexpansion_instate_weapons_regulations_desc:0 "The proliferation of weapons in the Republic has done much to let our ennemies operate without fear of retaliation. When a police action against a far-right contraband ring runs the risk of a violent gunfight against the equivalent of a platoon of soldiers with automatic rifles, hitting political criminal gangs hard becomes impossibly difficult.\n\nThe central government will introduce the first ever weapon regulation laws to the republic. The law will explicitly ban the possession of heavy weaponry. Equally under target will be automatic weapons, as well as large magazines.\n\nWe will use this law as both a carrot, and a stick. Extremists will be able to sell their weapons in a government buy back if they wish to quit politics, and those who hold on to their illegal weapons will be breaking the law and thus be easy to arrest."
 NIK_demexpansion_ban_unregistered_armed_groups_desc:0 "Beyond limiting access to weaponry, the government will also legislate paramilitaries out of existence. Outside of the army of the Republic, the police, as well as a few state backed militias, belonging to an group will be a criminal offense. Those who cling to their paramilitary membership will be arrested on terrorism charges; those who resist will be shot.\n\nThe designation of all those organizations as terrorist groups will allow us to hit their finances, starving them out of money. Violent confrontation need not end every one of them, as the dwindling money and prestige of paramilitary sees these groups hemorrhage members and morale."
 NIK_demexpansion_to_order_desc:0 "For as long as we have called Syvtyvkar our home, our rivals have mocked Komi's republic as a house of cards, toppled and rebuilt by ideologues constantly, its streets red with the blood of a slowly dying government.\n\nNo more! We have brought the Republic to order. Political extremism has been quelled, and peace and justice are the order of the day.\n\nSome might question Komi continuing to call itself "a place for all", in light of this quelled extremism. We stand by this statement, for all are welcome into the house of governments who will respect its institutions. Sacred hospitality is a two way obligation. Being now rid of those who would threaten others in our midst, we can continue to work on making the Republic a refuge for all Russians in this age of strife."
 NIK_demexpansion_codify_the_unwritten_rules_desc:0 "Komi has long prided itself on its tolerance of differing ideologies. People of all types call it home. The Republic's politicians are sharp, adept at political deals, trained by the ruthless nature of power in the Republic. Yes, this system's excesses have almost derailed our project. But why toss out the baby with the bathwater?\n\nThe unwritten rules will be codified. The radicals will be given their area to play in; as long as they respect the rules of the game, we will let them operate. In turn they will have to work with us as the Republic marches out against its rivals in Russian reunification.\n\nAfter all, might not the extremists be content with their own piece of the cake, once the Republic stretches from Finland to Manchuria?"
 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_the_remnants_desc:0 "Having broken the back of the far left and far right and sending their surviving leaders on the run, it is time to negotiate with their remnants.\n\nThe extremist paramilitaries have been a permanent thorn in our side, but their tenacity and resourcefulness has not gone unnoticed. What's more, a great deal of these thugs are officially soldiers and officers of the republic. Were we to purge extremism from our army, a great deal of experience would be bled out from the institution.\n\nWe will offer these crooks a deal: fight for us, or be hammered by the law. Any weapon and supplies that are brought from paramilitary control back into official use will be rewarded, and former paramilitaries who prove especially willing to work with us will see their army career given a slight boost."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_vilegodsk_conference_desc:0 "To show our goodwill to the far right and far left, a conference in Vilegodsk has been called to help establish a legal framework of spheres of influences within the republic. Political organizations will be allowed to run schools, unions, news agencies and other such services for their own community, with oversight from the central government.\n\nThe ability to live separately from offensive sociopolitical groups within a clearly defined framework will assuage fears that the central government is one decree away from outlawing personal rights. In return, high level members of sociopolitical groups will be in constant communication and coordination with the central government, all in the spirit of showing loyalty to the Republic and a commitment to keeping the system alive."
 NIK_demexpansion_centralize_redistricting_desc:0 "Woe to the conquered!\n\nOur willingness to cooperate with extremists who recognize their defeat should not be misunderstood for a willingness to turn the other cheek and forget past misdeeds. As such, our government will create a new centralized redistricting office that will be in charge of designing the Republic's electoral constituencies.\n\nUsing this technique we will harvest a bounty of centrist deputies who will help strengthen our grip on the legislative and executive wings of government. This will allow us to pummel renegade extremists, and tempt those willing to compromise to join us at the negotiating table."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_united_army_desc:0 "The Republic of Komi was founded on the ideals of those who had suffered the Gulags. Never again would the lash of repression strike upon an individual's back. We welcomed the accursed and the forsaken. Now our freedoms must be protected and upheld by those who would strip it away forever. We are an island of light and tolerance in a sea of darkness. Unfortunately the shadow clinging to our borders has taken root at home. Infighting infests the Republican Army not too dissimilar from cancer. Factionalism has set root from the squad level up to entire regiments being divided along ideological lines. We must break up these formations and reform them with a pluralistic mix, led by officers loyal to the ideals of the state than any self avowed creed. Already a new generation of military men are being instructed and trained to take command.\n\nAll that is required is the order."
 NIK_demexpansion_to_arms_desc:0 "Citizens, the Republic stands more united than ever! Once wasting time in pointless bickering and endless bloodshed, the children of the nation stand united and ready to face their enemies. Old rivalries have been ended in the name of stabilizing and expanding the Republic.\n\nNow that fascists and communists soldiers stand side by side with their democratic counterparts, Komi is ready to go on the offense. The experience of our men and the vast scope of personalities and ideas within our army grants us the flexibility needed to tackle any enemy!\n\nAt least, so goes the theory. The extremists have quieted down for now. We can only hope that they keep their end of the bargain, lest internecine squabbles threaten to destroy our Republic once more."
 NIK_demexpansion_peace_for_now_desc:0 "Perhaps just a passing dream? The streets of our capital are quiet, for once. A few families are seen walking about where once thugs manned barricades and checkpoints.\n\nThe police reports echo this anomaly. Peace seems to have descended on Syvtyvkar. A fragile peace perhaps, for the demons of civil strife might return if we are not vigilant. A fragile peace, if our rivals in western Russia try to end our democratic experiment. A peace, nonetheless, and one we intend to defend by force.\n\nCitizens, much remains to be done. We must be vigilant, so that our nation's future is not dashed against the rocks of war nor the chaos of internal conflict."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "The Republic, once seeing its electoral system frayed and closing down due to extremism, must see democracy flourish again.\n\nRegenerating the interest and trust our citizens have in the democratic process will be tough, especially coming on the tail end of our efforts to end political extremism once and for all. We must accomplish this nevertheless, if the democratic center's power is to be assured.\n\nLetting go of our power to design electoral districts now that they have been sanitized will help restore confidence. As will the ability to call snap elections to remove governments that are wildly unpopular with the electorate. Finally, propaganda campaigns extolling the virtue of engaged citizens will hopefully draw crowds once more to polling stations."
 NIK_demexpansion_new_election_cycles_desc:0 "Now that the Republic's bases are strong and secure, it is time to turn a new leaf.\n\nNew elections taking place in the rationalized and cleansed political arena will be scheduled. It is perhaps a risky move to entrust the fate of our project to the citizens. No riskier, however, than ruling in content of majority to further the end of small political cliques like our enemies in the far left and far right intended to do.\n\nOur new electoral cycle is set to hold elections around the time our army and diplomatic service is set to have reunited many regions of western Russia. Holding an election in freshly annexed or liberated territory must be difficult. But through this our new citizens will see our commitment to democratic ideals!"
 NIK_demexpansion_formalize_our_claims_desc:0 "Our enemies in the Revolutionary Front call us secessionists and traitors. The Tsar in Vyatka and his cronies dismiss us as the Syktyvkar clique. Others use our official name of the Komi Republic, seeing us as a mere local curiosity standing in their projects of uniting western Russia.\n\nThose names will be relegated to the past. Our government prepares a new declaration, announcing that we alone have the legitimacy to rule all of Russia as the Russian Republic. All of our institutions are to change to reflect this. Territory occupied by our military will merely be territory returning to our rightful rule. Diplomatic annexations will be undertaken under the auspices of bringing rogue provincial governors and usurpers back under the fold of the reborn Russian Republic.\n\nOur regional rivals are not likely to take this seriously. As such, we must be ready to prove our claims through force of arms... or through the silver-tongue of our diplomats. Nevertheless, the world shall know that the Russian Republic, killed by the Bolsheviks, is back!"
 NIK_demexpansion_the_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Our status as the true Russian Republic imposes on us a rewriting of our Constitution. Befitting our democratic beliefs, it is important to initiate a constitutional convention, and invite all those who seek to contribute to our constitution in good faith.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and many sources to analyse. Flawed as they were, the constitutions of the late imperial regime, of Kerensky's failed republic, and of the Soviet Union itself are all sources of ideas. Each of the ruling coalition's democratic parties are likely to have good suggestions. We can also expect reformed extremists to attend. Their best ideas must be entertained, and those that were once our rivals will now become our friend in the rebirth of Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_declare_the_free_republic_desc:0 "Men and women of the Republic, arise!\n\nFrom the Ural mountains on to the black mark of Moskowien, your fellow citizens everywhere are divided, enslaved by capricious tyrants or huddled in fragile statelets, awaiting liberation.\n\nAs the restored Russian Republic, our first aim is to unite western Russia into a new West Russian Free Republic. This does not shirk from our ambitions to free all of Russia, but rather confirm it! Once the greatest population centers that are free from German occupation are ours, our Republic will march east, to the Pacific!\n\nThe Tsarists, and the Communists of the Front, and the despicable dogs of the so called Army of Russian Liberation, let them all cower! The army of free men is on the march!"

 NIK_stalexpansion_restoring_order_desc:0 "The struggle for Russian reunification has begun, with territory after territory falling under our control. Yet even as we fight to rebuild our country, we are hampered by the political chaos of the Komi Republic, where extremists on either side of politics seek to take power by terroristic means. Even in our new territories, unrest and radicalism simmer. Russia cries out for true leadership. Thankfully, there is a woman with the talent, vision, and strength to seize the reigns of history and restore order in our fractured nation: Svetlana Stalina."
 NIK_stalexpansion_devolve_judicial_power_desc:0 "The judicial process in Komi is fair, but also inefficient and slow. With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."
 NIK_stalexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc:0 "While many of the world's democracies enshrine freedoms such as the freedom of speech as sacred and untouchable constructs, they have their downsides. President Stalina does not despise freedom of speech, she merely wishes to ensure the survival of the Republic. As such, using an executive directive, the freedom of speech shall be suspended entirely, so that it may not be abused by radicals to spread hate and strife.\n\nThis is merely a temporary measure, and these legal protections shall be returned once the crisis is under control, we assure you."
 NIK_stalexpansion_make_an_example_desc:0 "Our government has recently captured several extremist paramilitaries, whose ideologies have cost the lives of countless innocent souls. They continued to spread hate and destruction within our Republic, and are complicit in the cycle of coups that President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are attempting to end. They must be made an example, an example of the punishment reserved for spreading hate and discord, for propagating extremism and violence.\n\nTheir trials shall be quick, expedited through our new judicial policies. We shall line up these communists and fascists against a wall and eradicate their hatred from this world. May God have mercy on their souls."
 NIK_stalexpansion_seize_unregistered_firearms_desc:0 "As we have waged our war to reunite Russia and vanquish the warlords, we have increasingly found that many civilians in our newly acquired territories possess their own firearms. Russia has been a dangerous place in recent times, and we would not deprive our citizens of the right to arm themselves for protection and self-defence. Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."
 NIK_stalexpansion_clear_the_streets_desc:0 "Street protests, violent crime, and other civil disturbances continue to plague our cities at precisely the time the campaign to restore Russia to greatness requires order and discipline. It is time to put a stop to such nonsense, by any means necessary. We will deploy the police, our greatest defence against anarchy, across the cities of Russia, and put an end to the chaos. Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_crisis_calmed_desc:0 "Thankfully, due to all of our efforts to remove extremist ideas from our republic the immediate crisis seems to have been calmed. However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our republic is secured."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_national_reconstruction_council_desc:0 "President Stalina needs a group of people to aid her in stabilizing Komi, and has found her solution in the form of the National Reconstruction Council. Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."
 NIK_stalexpansion_guarantees_to_the_national_assembly_desc:0 "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. Some have even gone so far as to call President Stalina a dictator, and anti-democratic. What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."
 NIK_stalexpansion_extend_emergency_powers_desc:0 "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."
 NIK_stalexpansion_issue_the_fundamental_directives_desc:0 "The Komi Republic is beset on all sides by extremists, radicals and rabble-rousers who seek to undermine the stability of the nation, planning to destroy the rights of the common man in favour of building twisted "utopias" based on their ideas. This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc:0 "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc:0 "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 NIK_stalexpansion_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc:0 "Nothing is more sacred on this green Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. Hence, it is by the guns and tanks of the Komi Army that the light of democracy is carried to the furthest depths of Russia. Hence, we must issue an ultimatum to all the tyrannies and despotates that we encounter on the road to reunification: accept integration into the Republic, or war. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc:0 "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold the [NIK.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by [GetNIKSocDemLeader], the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Alexei Kosygin.

[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will criss-cross the [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."

Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party."\n\n[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will go on a speaking tour in factories across the [NIK.GetName].

In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 NIK_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc:0 "The [NIK.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross the [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under the [NIK.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our republic."
 NIK_second_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc:0 ""While West Russians may now breathe free, the wolves lurking at our borders hunger for their blood. The DSNP and SMR may wax enthusiastic about their social 'reforms', but none of them can tell you how they'll keep you safe from an invasion. But our party has an answer: Funding the finest military in Russia."\n\nThe PSD will appeal to national defense in order to rally votes. They will unveil a plan to double defense spending and purchase state of the art equipment from overseas. Peace comes from superior firepower, and voters will know that only the PSD can keep the peace in the [NIK.GetName]."
 NIK_second_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc:0 "The Komi Republic began with a dream; a dream that one day all Russia would be one, democratic, and free. A dream that prosperity would abound from Murmansk to Magadan, not because it was planned by party bureaucrats, but because Russia's leaders trusted its people to build it themselves. Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by the [NIK.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Alexei Kosygin and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign. Kosygin will criss-cross the [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting his beautiful vision of liberty and prosperity. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc:0 ""You Russian students are the builders of the new tomorrow. The DSNP only cares for men who swing a wrench and the PSD chide you to 'follow your elders,' the same elders who let our nation fall to the Germans. I have a different message, dear youth: Russia needs you. It needs your creativity. It needs the diligence you show in your studies. It needs your mastery of the arts and sciences. Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture."\n\nKosygin will launch a speaking tour across the [NIK.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Kosygin is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the [GetYear] elections."
 NIK_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc:0 "Kosygin is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save the [NIK.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across the [NIK.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 NIK_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc:0 "Campaigning season is over and the [NIK.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast]'s democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Kosygin's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in the [NIK.GetName]."

 ### DEMOCRATIC REGIONALS DESCS ###
 NIK_voznesensky_a_socialist_mandate_desc:0 "As Russia roils and bleeds around us, we must cling to the principles which have brought us this far: to the ideals of our Constitution. Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc:0 "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc:0 "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringes never again regain a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc:0 "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 NIK_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc:0 "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 NIK_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc:0 "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc:0 "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 NIK_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc:0 "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 NIK_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc:0 "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as "Democratic Hegemony", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc:0 "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the republic would fall to extremism."
 NIK_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc:0 "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party it's ruling place or even the permanent stability of the republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc:0 "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc:0 "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, 'The Autonomy Question' as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as 'soft separatism' and 'subversion of ethnic equality', many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 NIK_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc:0 "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as "eroding the principle of universal equality the republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 NIK_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc:0 "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 NIK_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc:0 "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia, it robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc:0 "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 NIK_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc:0 "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 NIK_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the republic in its moment of weakness."
 NIK_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc:0 "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 NIK_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc:0 "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 NIK_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc:0 "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the president being formally codified."
 NIK_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc:0 "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the four-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 NIK_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc:0 "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 NIK_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc:0 "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 NIK_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc:0 "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 NIK_stalina_empower_the_party_desc:0 "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 NIK_stalina_public_concessions_desc:0 "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 NIK_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc:0 "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstriction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 NIK_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc:0 "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 NIK_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc:0 "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 NIK_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc:0 "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 NIK_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc:0 "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the republic will choose between a new president and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."

 NIK_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc:0 "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 NIK_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc:0 "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 NIK_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 NIK_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc:0 "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 NIK_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc:0 "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 NIK_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc:0 "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 NIK_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc:0 "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers.But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."
 NIK_stalina_accept_the_big_tent_model_desc:0 "Accept the Big-Tent Model"
 NIK_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc:0 "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 NIK_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc:0 "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 NIK_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc:0 "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 NIK_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc:0 "It is time for the signature policy of the SDP to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our republic. If you want to gain access to our bountiful resources, you must make an alliance with us. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 NIK_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc:0 "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say "enough!"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 NIK_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc:0 "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 NIK_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc:0 "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 NIK_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc:0 "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 NIK_stalina_a_united_russia_desc:0 "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 NIK_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."
 NIK_stalina_honor_the_republics_heroes_desc:0 "Due to our history as a unifier of western Russia, our Republic is a Republic of heroes. Innumerable men and women fought to make our Republic whole and put down the tyrannical extremists and warlords that once blighted Russia from Arkhangelsk to Samara. After such service to our Republic, we, too, deserve to provide a service to our veterans and heroic soldiers. Veterans of the West Russian War and Unification Wars shall be taken care of, provided with a generous stipident as a reward for their service.\n\nAdditionally, this action presents a wonderful opportunity for the image of our party. Regardless of one's alignment within the PSD, all of our Deputies and regional politicians can at least agree on the fact that Russia's heroes deserve recognition. Let us assist them, and in doing so, assist the longevity of our party's administration."
 NIK_stalina_emphasize_shared_identity_desc:0 "Regardless of our heritage, be we Great Russian, Tatar, Jewish, German, or Ukrainian, we are all united in our participation within our democracy, and our residence within the Republic. Whilst the politicians of the left and right may call out to silence peoples solely for their faith or ethnicities, we have the position above all of them, atop the pinnacle of democracy. Our policy regardign ethnicity, thusly, shall focus on the fact that all of us are citizens of the Republic - participants in the grand democratic experiment that has already liberated so much of our Motherland.\n\nWe may call ourselves Great Russians, or Tatars, or Ukrainians - but, in heart, we are all equal in patriotic humanity."
 NIK_stalina_redeeming_our_history_desc:0 "The streets of the Republic were no longer a battleground for feuding radicals, nor were political assassinations a viable way to mark the passing of the days. The leadership of Svetlana Stalina had cleaned up the behaviour of the people, but it could not wipe away their opinions. The debate of how the history of our Republic should be discussed has become a contentious subject in the halls of legislature, with many calling for a focus on the "Glory of Russia". They say that leftism and division has diluted the common identity of the Russian people, and desire for that to be rectified. The Left has mobilised their political capital against this, but it's the Right who holds the keys to power that are needed for the unification of Russia."

 NIK_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 NIK_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "Komi exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 NIK_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc:0 "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 NIK_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc:0 "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 NIK_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc:0 "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 NIK_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc:0 "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 NIK_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc:0 "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 NIK_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc:0 "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 NIK_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 NIK_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc:0 "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 NIK_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc:0 "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 NIK_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc:0 "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 NIK_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 NIK_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 NIK_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."

 NIK_kosygin_springtime_in_russia_desc:0 "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Kosygin has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_democracy_desc:0 "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 NIK_kosygin_freedom_and_fairness_desc:0 "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Kosygin has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 NIK_kosygin_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 NIK_kosygin_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc:0 "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 NIK_kosygin_towards_a_shining_future_desc:0 "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_unity_desc:0 "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 NIK_kosygin_the_violet_platform_desc:0 "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_worker_desc:0 "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 NIK_kosygin_the_sovereign_coalition_desc:0 "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently social-democratic, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereignists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_people_desc:0 "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 NIK_kosygin_a_show_of_cooperation_desc:0 "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_reform_desc:0 "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 NIK_kosygin_assist_the_republics_desc:0 "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 NIK_kosygin_cultural_exhibits_desc:0 "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Kosygin has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 NIK_kosygin_protect_natural_beauty_desc:0 "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 NIK_kosygin_uplift_minority_rights_desc:0 "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 NIK_kosygin_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."
 
 NIK_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 NIK_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc:0 "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Western Russian Free Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 NIK_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc:0 "Several of our economic advisers believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the Western Russian Free Republic, we have decided to try the 'capitalist turning into socialist' economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 NIK_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc:0 "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 NIK_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc:0 "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Western Russian Free Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the DSNP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 NIK_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc:0 "Here in the Free Republic we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 NIK_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc:0 "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 NIK_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc:0 "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the [NIK.GetName]."
 NIK_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc:0 "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 NIK_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc:0 "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 NIK_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc:0 "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 NIK_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc:0 "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 NIK_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 NIK_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 NIK_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunately, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings! "

 NIK_kosygin_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Kosygin is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 NIK_kosygin_establish_the_economic_zones_desc:0 "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 NIK_kosygin_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc:0 "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 NIK_kosygin_aid_for_the_farmers_desc:0 "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 NIK_kosygin_open_the_republic_desc:0 "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 NIK_kosygin_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc:0 "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 NIK_kosygin_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 NIK_kosygin_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc:0 "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 NIK_kosygin_foreign_investment_incentives_desc:0 "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 NIK_kosygin_project_kibersin_desc:0 "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Kosygin is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project Kibersin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most centralized and efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology..."
 NIK_kosygin_managerial_socialism_desc:0 "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 NIK_kosygin_for_our_prosperity_desc:0 "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."

The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 NIK_kosygin_a_bright_generation_desc:0 "President Kosygin is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started. Russia's future lives and dies in the hearts of these future workers and intellectuals - in the generation that will shine brightest of all."

 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc:0 "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc:0 "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 NIK_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 NIK_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 NIK_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 NIK_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc:0 "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."

Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc:0 "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 NIK_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc:0 "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 NIK_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc:0 "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 NIK_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 NIK_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc:0 "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 
 NIK_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc:0 "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_open_the_gates_desc:0 "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 NIK_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc:0 "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like Fascism and Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of Authoritarian regimes."
 NIK_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc:0 "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as "just another warlord state". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, England, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 NIK_democratic_embassy_funding_desc:0 "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_call_for_investment_desc:0 "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 NIK_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc:0 "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the Western side of the Atlantic."
 NIK_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc:0 "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [NIK.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 NIK_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc:0 "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

The usual suspects are running fierce campaigns to make their way to the top, and as always, only one will become Russia's helmsman for the next few years.\n\nOf course, considering our current position as master of Western Russia, whoever wins the presidency is likely to go down in history as the one who finally made the nation whole again after nearly thirty years of strife. Such a fact is not lost on the contenders, who each have their own ideas of how the reunification should play out..."

 NIK_third_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc:0 "The People's Democratic Socialist Republic has always been a powerful force in the republic's politics, ever since the party stood beside Nikolai Voznesensky when he founded it. However, the party has also been a consistently divisive topic, as Voznesensky has proven to be a problematic figure at even the best of times.\n\nA newcomer, Alexander Yakovlev, wishes to change the party's troubled reputation. He is now running a campaign based on ideals of democratic socialism, free from the mistakes made by the party in years past. Only time will tell if his bold promises will pay off."

 NIK_third_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc:0 "The DSNP, above all, serves the working class of the republic. This is no reason to grow complacent, however, as the other parties are already seeking to encroach upon our most important base of support.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev already has plans to tour the industrial centers of the nation, and to publicly shake hands with the most influential worker's councils of our cities. With the councils on our side, we may have an easier time organizing future campaigns. Most importantly, however, this show of good faith will restore the worker's confidence in our party, and once again solidify our voter base."
 NIK_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda:0 "A Radical New Platform"
 NIK_third_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc:0 "The DSNP has long been an advocate of democratic socialism, even during the days of the Voznesentsiy. However, certain compromises in these ideals had to be made to ensure better cooperation with the coalition to stem the tide of radicalism. Now that the storm has passed, the time has come for a new platform to reaffirm our commitment to socialism.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev has given the party the green light to make public this new platform, which is far more radical than anything we have seen before. It calls for a renewed push towards a democratic transition towards socialism, as well as a strict adherence to radical worker's rights policies. Women's rights, which were always present but never really the main focus, have been reemphasized as part of the party's goals. These policies may be seen as a bold shift towards the far left, but Yakovlev is confident that this new direction will revitalize the party for years to come."

No, today we stand against the German and those who seek Russia to remain fractured!"\n\n"We fight to make sure no son or daughter of Russia will ever watch the Luftwaffe reign hellfire from the skies!

 NIK_third_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "The Sovereign Democratic Party was founded at a time when Komi faced threats largely from within. It was a call by those who would see democracy preserved from the radicals, by any means necessary. Some in our party argue that our purpose has been served. No longer do radicals threaten to steal our freedoms. Instead, the officials of the PSD argue that we must look outward. Effective immediately, the party's platform for the upcoming election will incorporate a strong, pro-unification message. How the nature of Russian legislation will be left largely in the hands of local politicians. The focus of the national government will be on a massive rearmament program, which will improve industry, infrastructure, and provide employment to hundreds of thousands of Russians. Who can compete with that?"
 NIK_third_election_an_appeal_to_force:0 "Stress the Border Issue"
 NIK_third_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc:0 "Just across the A-A line lies our occupied homeland. Long ago, Bukharin's Soviet Union fell to the Germans and occupied the heartland of our country. Later, Vorishilov's West Russian Revolutionary Front tried to take it back, but the West Russian War and the Republic's independence led to the war's eventual failure.\n\nHowever, now we have an opportunity. While we can not invade the remnants of Moskowien right now, we can start to press the issue of the border to the general public. Troops will be sent to ensure the warlords who have emerged do not invade the Republic and Russian refugees are taken care of. We can not take back what is rightfully ours so long as our flank is exposed, but we certainly can make our case known that all of Russia, including Moskowien, is rightfully ours."
 NIK_third_election_the_SMR_campaign:0 "The SMR Campaign"
 NIK_third_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc:0 "It's election time once again in the Republic, and the Union of Young Reformers has a serious chance of achieving victory. Naturally, a winning strategy will require a winning campaign, emphasizing issues that Russia's voters see as relevant to their own lives and choosing popular policies in response to them. But, as the question always is, what to choose?\n\nRussia as it stands is backwards, uneducated, and globally isolated. It has been so for decades, and voters no doubt want things to change. Here is where the SMR can present its recipe for the nation's recovery: expanded investment in education, free trade policy so capital can flow into Russia once again, and the construction of robust ties to the free world. May Russia's rise to global prominence mirror our rise in the polls."
 NIK_third_election_meet_with_the_youth:0 "Connect with the Intellectuals"
 NIK_third_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc:0 "The SMR's philosophy emphasizes the values of openness, humanism, and intellectual achievement. Unsurprisingly, this makes the middle classes and the intellectual elite natural bases for the party. Any successful campaign will involve mobilizing voters of higher status, whether material or educational, to the polls in order to beat the other parties' rabble, and voters don't simply turn out because of similar social class.\n\nThe SMR needs an effective infrastructure that can mobilize this base, and the best way of doing so is by meeting them where they are. Sending campaign officials to donors and universities will allow us to build the party's connections to voters just in time to shepherd them to the polls."
 NIK_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future:0 "A Platform for a New Century"
 NIK_third_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc:0 "Alexei Kosygin was a very principled leader, and he helped raise Russia's new democracy from infancy. However, he still held onto obsolete ideals, elements of Russia's Soviet past; while his methods were liberal and democratic, his ends were socialist, even if they were less so than Voznesensky or the extreme left. This element of the SMR was already vestigial when Kosygin was in office, and it is now time to move on.\n\nThe new platform will invoke our earlier ideals of freedom, both in speech and in markets, and of sensible international cooperation, while quietly abandoning Kosygin's leftist sympathies. While some voters may be upset by the transition, others previously hostile to voting for a socialist should more than make up the difference."

 NIK_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc:0 "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today Syktyvkar and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 NIK_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Yakovlev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with Syktyvkar's finest."
 NIK_dsnp_strengthen_the_social_economy_desc:0 "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 NIK_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 NIK_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 NIK_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc:0 "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 NIK_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying Syktyvkar's ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adveraries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 NIK_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc:0 "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 NIK_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc:0 "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 NIK_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc:0 "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberian Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 NIK_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc:0 "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 NIK_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 NIK_dsnp_flying_together_desc:0 "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Yakovlev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 NIK_dsnp_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "Four times have our fellow socialists derided the methods we abide. Four again have results bade them peace.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Yakovlev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

Our government has determined the cities of Tyumen, Omsk, Sverdlovsk, and Nizhny Tagil to be prime locations for these offices. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated cities, but they are also the largest economies in Western Siberia, and therefore are most in need of Project KiberSin's optimization."

As such, our President has approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern, to be aided by Project KiberSin once it is further developed, in order to ensure that oil reaches its destination on time and in sufficient quantities. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs.

We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 NIK_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 NIK_smr_crafting_our_future_desc:0 "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 NIK_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc:0 "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 NIK_smr_new_conservationism_desc:0 "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."
 NIK_smr_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises. "
 NIK_smr_flying_together_desc:0 "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Katushev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 NIK_smr_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "Once upon a time, Konstantin Katushev's erstwhile allies would have scoffed at his vision opposite the Assembly's aisle. Their opinions no longer matter now - but for posterity's sake, he has had the last laugh.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Katushev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 NIK_psd_the_sovereign_mandate_desc:0 "We just secured a new mandate spanning the entirety of Russia. We must use it to spread our fair democracy to our brethren in West Russia as well as our new residents in West Siberia. Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 NIK_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 NIK_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population. Our citizens often criticize our military expansion, which leads to conflict between civilians and the government. A new welfare program should both strengthen the Republic and quell the many disputes arising between our people and the administration."
 NIK_psd_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Through our military conquests we have captured many sources of oil. We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens. It would be beneficial for us to create our very own oil and gas administration to manage the energy resources we have gathered. Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 NIK_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia. We need to establish a central bank that can invest in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, anything to enhance our public finance. Having this kind of investment fund will pull us closer to the economic prosperity we need to produce a strong Russia and help our citizens live wealthy lives."
 NIK_psd_siberian_security_desc:0 "Our conquests in West Siberia not only gave us more resources to work with, but we also have more potential threats to handle. Political opponents still remain throughout the deserted region. We must make sure the residents of Siberia are held to the same nationwide standards as everyone else, while getting rid of the dreaded Tyumen and Black League terrorists. It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."
 NIK_psd_the_association_registry_act_desc:0 "With an ever-growing population of Russians from across Eurasia, there is bound to be a few political dissenters here and there. We must make it clear that some of these ideologies will not be tolerated, as they are against the principles of human liberty. We should pass an act that requires all former members of the Communist Party and Black League to disclose their membership so that we know who these dissenters are. Any person who was once affiliated with either party and refused to disclose it will be arrested."
 NIK_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_desc:0 "We look to the East and find our newly acquired West Siberian region, a place where trade once reigned as Yevgeny Dragunov made a fortune selling his guns to the long-extinguished warlords. We could learn a few lessons from his government's former administration. We need to partner up with Zlatoust's former bureaucrats and businessmen to solidify our control of the region, while also scouting for people who are experienced in administrative positions."
 NIK_psd_extending_democracy_desc:0 "We have been growing powerful in our little corner of the world, and some in our administration even say we're approaching World Power status. It seems like our mission of spreading democracy to all of Russia is finally starting to pay dividends. Our people could always use a morale boost to get them working harder, encouraging them to go beyond the imaginary limits that once confined us to our portion of Russia. We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 NIK_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc:0 "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 NIK_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc:0 "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections. We will establish a framework for regional referendums to ensure that the public majority still supports our cause even if we somehow lose the next vote. That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."
 NIK_psd_further_ofn_ties_desc:0 "Many members of our government watched the rise of Fascist and Communist regimes with their own eyes, and we all watched chaos ravage what was left of the Soviet Union. Even today, we often witness the brutal oppression set forth by the Nazi Party and the Empire of Japan. Our democratic brothers in North America and Australia work to defend the fledgeling democracies around the world, and we want to join their ranks one day. To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions"
 NIK_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc:0 "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 NIK_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government now controls all of western Russia, with the recent annexation of Western Siberia. However, Western Siberia is marred by terrorism and the aftermath of extremist regimes. Tyumen's Communist Party and the Black League need to be hunted down and exterminated. Once that is done, we can build a decent administration in the region, that will facilitate our eastern expansion. It will be hard work, but President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are used to hard work at this point."
 NIK_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc:0 "The people of Russia need something to trust, something to keep them safe, something to support. We need to show them that we are the party of strength, stability, and national pride. We need to secure the people's support, because without it Russia will surely fall to extremism. Therefore, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved increased production of propaganda, and bribing off every semi-important public figure we can find. Once the people are surrounded on all sides by praise, they will have no choice but to support the Reconstruction Government."
 NIK_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 NIK_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc:0 "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 NIK_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 NIK_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 NIK_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western SIberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 NIK_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc:0 "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 NIK_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc:0 "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 NIK_stalina_redefining_politics_desc:0 "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side.""
 NIK_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc:0 "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 NIK_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc:0 "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 NIK_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc:0 "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee. To acquire this guarantee, the National Sovereignty Act can be used as leverage, since the United States is always willing to work with those who provide them the economic incentives to do so. With America's guarantee, the Motherland's bright and prosperous future will be ensured."
 NIK_stalina_look_to_challenges_ahead_desc:0 "The Reconstruction has accomplished a great deal, and now Western Siberia is fully integrated into our Republic, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead that we must face. However, with the combined power of our strength and our principles, we can move forward. We can unite the Motherland. We can bring stability to her people. We can turn the Motherland into a titan, ready to avenge her humiliation, and liberate Moscow and her citizens. We can achieve all of this, and the Motherland will finally be free from the shackles that extremists placed upon her."

 komiintro.0.t:0 "The Republic"
 komiintro.0.d:0 "The Komi Republic - a rare democracy within the Russian Anarchy. Almost unique for a statelet in the bomb-ravaged west, the Republic functions as an independent nation-state, with a formalized economy, political system, and the closest thing to free elections that one is likely to get in West Russia.\n\nEver since the foundation of the Republic in the wake of the West Russian War, putting an end to the political violence that plagued Syktyvkar beforehand, the Republic has stood strong, its borders spanning from the Vychegda to the Vyatka Rivers, and its economy managing to grow slowly and steadily.\n\nHowever, the foundation of the Republic did not end the woes of Syktyvkar and the Komi region in general. The city of Syktyvkar, during the West Russian War, gained a reputation as a cutthroat and critical node of the Front's governing apparatus. Former political prisoners and ideologues were set free to ply their trades in the city, as the authority that ran their former prisons dissolved. Political refugees from all corners of West Russia fled into the Republic - socialists and republicans from Vyatka and right-wingers from Arkhangelsk mingled freely in the teeming capital of the Republic.\n\nKomi is known for its democracy, indeed, but the results of this reputation as a place of freedom has acquired an ugly side - the paramilitaries.\n\nThe streets of Syktyvkar are infamous for their bouts of political paramilitary violence, protests and riots. With the second national-level election approaching in late 1963, this violence has only been growing, and many of the citizens of the Republic wonder - can democracy survive in Komi, or is it doomed to fall to despotism like the rest of the Russian anarchy?"
 komiintro.0.a:0 "We shall bear the torch forevermore."

 komiintro.1.t:0 "The Custodian"
 komiintro.1.d:0 "The workday of Nikolai Voznesensky passed in an unbearable, soul-crushing yet in no way carefree routine. Only having reached the threshold of the presidential residence with his leisurely step, the President was immediately caught in the intrigues and schemes of the Komi politics, dealing with the chaos that engulfed the newborn Republic. The chaos to which he no less than the radicals he despised.\n\nIn a short moment of distraction, Voznesensky could not help but indulge himself in reminiscences about the early days of the Republic, the time when everything seemed so easy, so achievable. The applauding crowd in the speech hall, the lowered Soviet flag, the cheering demonstrations for the new era in the Russian democracy - it looked so vivid and yet so dissonant with his new reality.\n\nThe idealistic memories of the birth of the Republic were darkened by the image of Zhdanov, a Janus-faced and smug creature accompanied by Suslov, the Mephistopheles in flesh, all sitting next to him on the round table and waiting for their share in the newly founded state. He held nothing but contempt for them, but even being charitable to his past actions, he was honest at least to himself about his own role in enabling the Communists, in their corruption of the young democracy.\n\nPerhaps, all of it could be done differently. The Republic didn't have to surrender to the Communist demands in exchange for the false sense of security. It didn't have to be a welcoming haven for the pitiable scum who found no place for themselves but in Syktyvkar. Whether what could be done, it is much too late. The past was the past. All that mattered was that Voznesensky had to carry his unenviable burden alone, clumsily maneuvering in the web that enveloped Komi.\n\nThe sound of gunfire behind the window helped to sober his reflections. Sighing in response to the habitual barbarity he grew used to a long time ago, Voznesensky took a folder in the bosom and put on his coat. Leaving the residence, he took a long way to his house, to the opposite side of the road where another street fight occurred."

 komiintro.2.d:0 "The meeting was mostly going as planned. Alexei Kosygin was discussing various topics with several of the more right-wing members of the democratic coalition. The discussions of future cabinet positions went fine, with Kosygin mostly satisfied with the various compromises made. He had managed to squeeze in a few more candidates from his own party, the Union of Young Reformers. He discussed upcoming campaign strategies, seeing which districts would have more or less funding from which parties, and working to discuss ways to penetrate some of the more radical districts. However, Kosygin was not surprised when the mention of political radicals derailed the meeting.\n\n"Those communists are going to tear down all of the progress we've made in the name of their so-called 'people's revolution!' Popular my ass, our democratic coalition is the only thing keeping Komi from falling to wanna-be despots!" exclaimed one politician, and it seemed many of those present agreed with him. He continued on, "And what is Voznesensky doing, huh?! He's cuddling with them! The DSNP are destroying this coalition, and I won't stand for it!" This could get out of hand, a fracture in the coalition could seriously damage their performance in the elections, allowing the radicals to gain power. Kosygin had to do something.\n\n"Friends, colleagues, I understand your fears, truly, I do. I myself am wary of Voznesensky's weak stance towards extremism. However, endangering the coalition's unity is not what the Republic needs, we must instead look at our alternatives," Kosygin paused briefly, "Voznesensky has led our Republic for some time, and Komi has grown considerably under his leadership despite the bombings. However, Komi, I feel, may need someone new in charge. Someone who can truly heal Komi of its most infectious disease. Elections are soon, friends, and we stand for democracy, do we not?" Kosygin had been thinking about the elections a lot recently, and the idea of becoming President was becoming more and more seductive. Either way, it seems his colleagues were pleased by his little speech, and it seems disaster had been averted for now."

She would be perfect. Another name went down on the list she was assembling - another person to contact, to fund, and align. One more for the endless lists of personnel that the governing coalition employed to keep the Republic running.\n\nA thought flickered through her mind - an image of her combined proposals for appointments. What a government that would be! Free of radicals and subversives, free of corruption, and dedicated to the Republic over all else. Men and women who knew, above all, that there was a greater good to work towards.\n\nAs she placed the list to the side, and looked absently at the now cold cup of tea that was sitting forgotten on the other side of her desk, she wondered just how her personal path had ended here. Her transformation from the young decadent party-goer that she resented so much, to a dedicated public servant.\n\nIt did not matter, she decided. It was merely a matter for a record, to be consigned to distant memory.\n\nAs always, in personal development and politics, the true important thing to think about was the ends - the now, and the future."

Clutching the pistol at his side, he advanced down the hall, ignoring the quiet chatter of the bodyguards in the other rooms. They wouldn't dare disturb their master while he slept, he hoped, prayed, even. As he reached the last door, a plain, wooden thing, and wrapped his shaking hand around the knob, Anatoly felt a small smile creep onto his face. This was much easier than expected, wasn't it? All he had to do was shoot an old, sleeping man in the head, and it would be done. The Republic would be free of a devil.\n\nAnatoly entered the small bedroom, squinting in the dark as he raised his pistol at the dark mass on the bed -\n\nThe first shot hit Anatoly in the hand. The next in the knee. He squealed in pain as he snapped his gaze towards the darkened corner the shots had come from, nausea rocking his stomach as he met the gaze of his target, sitting comfortably on a leather chair.\n\n"Come now," Mikhail Suslov intoned, barely above a whisper. "Surely you didn't think no one's ever attempted to kill me before?" Anatoly opened his mouth to speak, to jeer the famed shadow master of Komi; all that exited his throat was a whimper. Suslov shook his head. "A shame. Usually Gumilyov's lambs are made of sterner stuff."\n\nHe pulled the trigger again, and Anatoly saw no more.\n\nSuslov stood from his chair, sliding the still-smoking pistol back into his jacket, gaze fixed on his bodyguard as he burst into the room.

He placed the long case in the field, withdrawing the tripod, deftly expanding it, and attaching the telescope to the top.\n\nHis nighttime adventures were a risk, of course. Suslov had expressed concern for his safety, fearing assassination attempts from the Passionariyy. But if even Comrade Suslov's men did not know of his excursions, how dangerous could it be?\n\nGlancing into the telescope, Andrei Zhdanov's mind wandered. Far away from the lights of Syktyvkar, that snake pit of intrigue and violence, he found serenity in the gentle movements of the stars. Perhaps out there, lay hope. Other beings who overcame their petty infighting and defeated their worst qualities, an example for humanity to follow into a new age. Freedom from want, freedom from conflict, and freedom from ignorance lay within the grasp of humanity. It was such a shame that it had been squandered for so long, on the petty conflicts of the last decade and the great battle with the backwards, regressive Germany.\n\nBut soon, the time would come.

They never asked her anything about herself, she noticed, only her father. "Your father would be so proud," They'd say, "If only he could see you now," to which she'd smile and agree, promising to follow in dear old Nikolai's footsteps.\n\nShe wasn't so ignorant. This meeting was a productive one, though not for the reasons the rest of the Communist Party thought. It wasn't a mere get-together for her, no, this was a valuable opportunity to learn who the true threats in Komi were, and more importantly, how they could be taken down. The man who had just spoken to her, she noticed with some grim satisfaction, was a coward. The second she'd disagreed with him on a minor dispute, he'd backed down and apologized thoroughly. Someone like that was a follower, not a leader.\n\nSerov had watched her carefully, as expected. A fearsome man, for sure, but he hadn't considered that his prey would be watching him just as carefully. What she took the most interest in was the man's apparent disregard for common Communist Theory - the way he spoke reminded Svetlana of what little Nazi propaganda she had suffered through in the past.\n\nThe Party was nearing a breaking point, she concluded at the end of the night. Zhdanov and Suslov, for all of their attempts to enforce unity, could not control everyone. Serov would be the first to go, she reasoned, but certainly not the last. A new rising star in the party would be a welcome sight for many, a reassurance that the glory days of the Union were not all lost.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina would be that, but unlike her dear father, she wouldn't let Russia slip through her fingers."

He hadn't slept well in weeks, and so he had developed this habit of watching the city below, pondering his existence. He was a socialist, he reasoned, always among the most loyal in the entirety of the NKVD, so why did he have so many doubts of late?\n\nHe was always proud of Russia, nationalistically so, even, but surely that was merely because of their former status as a great socialist power? And certainly not in the same way as the Italians, or even the Germans? He shook his head. No, he was better than them, wasn't he?\n\nBut why shouldn't one be devoted to their home above all else? Perhaps the Union wouldn't have fallen if they had fought with the same brutal pride that the Nazis did? Serov felt a churning of doubt within his gut, one that had only intensified over the past weeks. Perhaps he wasn't wrong? Maybe, just maybe, it was Suslov and Zhdanov were misguided about such questions?\n\nMaybe Serov could teach them his new ideas?\n\nA smile crossed his face as he considered, and for the first time in what seemed like years, the churning in his guts lessened. He would lead the Communist Party, and Komi with it, to greatness.\n\nHe stormed to his desk, placed a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter, and began.\n\nWith this, he would change socialism forever."

Eurasianism had never quite caught on in the Komi Republic, apart from in his own clique. It wasn't that he or his ideas were an unknown quantity in the Republic - quite the opposite. His infamy was likely the reason that the evening of lectures had been boycotted by Komi's leftists and democrats. And yet, despite everything, he still stood facing a packed theater - one that was conspicuously devoid of hecklers.\n\n"Often," he said, moving into the end of his lecture, "I am thus interrogated: 'Lev Nikolayevich, you call yourself a rightist, yet you advocate against the very things that all true rightists stand for! You do not stand for the church, for the supremacy of Russia, for the glory of the Tsars! What, then, can you possibly offer the people of Russia?'"\n\nThe audience remained silent - but it was a silence of rapt attention. The speaker continued. "People of Syktyvkar, you have heard me speak at length tonight of concepts that I do not expect any of you to grasp: Eurasia, Passionariyy, the will to change. You came here expecting to hear an alternative to the corrupt and inefficient democracy imposed upon us. I will confess that I am more comfortable explaining myself through the written word, but for the benefit of those not similarly inclined, allow me to elucidate my message as clearly as I can..."\n\nThe room remained silent, and the speaker knew he had them. "I envision a power to eclipse any that has preceded it. A continent-spanning project wherein the greatest strains of the motherland's ethnicities are forged into an indivisible whole, capitulating only to the singular authority of the state. Not a weary old empire, where a single ethnos seizes power only to stagnate and fall before a mightier foe, but a supra-national entity - the summation of all that has come before it. It will not merely be the Russians and their strengths, but the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs, the Mongols, the Buryats, and so many more! All of us, inheritors of a combined legacy, standing together under a single banner: the Eurasian State!"\n\nAs the audience exploded into applause that was more than merely respectful, someone leaned over to his friend and asked innocently: "Pavel, what was that guy's name again?""

This particular street was difficult to optimize, and it might be better to remove it entirely. Eraser at hand, he wiped it off the map. Much better.\n\nHe adjusted his glasses, discarding his pencil for a pen. He took a step back, seeing his work in its entirety for the first time since last night. To Shafarevich, it was beautiful. Ordered roads, with its sidewalks and pavements, made precisely to accommodate not only the people of Syktyvkar but also to compensate for its population growth. Everyone in Syktyvkar could get from one point to another in less than an hour's travel time. He put the tip of his pen onto the drawing board.\n\nOthers in the National Assembly had mocked him before. The lines on two streets intersected. He reached out to his eraser, finding it in his pocket after a few moments of frantic searching. He erased the obstacle, rearranging them to bear each other's weight, one incoming, one oncoming. This proposal might not get anywhere, considering the political nature of the Republic, but the work was its own reward. Now onto this sidewalk, and unto this pavement, as he drew in his lines and dotted in points along with them: streetlights.\n\nAll of this done, Shafarevich decided to test his creation. The walk from his home to the National Assembly was fifteen minutes. He picked up his pencil again, tracing it along the new route. In his head, his mind ticked. Two meters a second, average walking speed. Nine, ten. Ten minutes! Now for the next step. Much property destruction would be involved in the realization of this plan, and he laid the original design on top of his. Taking out his notebook, he began to count."

In response, he felt the flame of faith roar to life inside him again, driving the cold from his body. He gasped at the sudden intensity of its heat, but stayed perfectly still.

The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation.

They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 NIK.16.a:0 "Drop the hammer!"
 NIK.16.b:0 "There will be no hasty moves."

 NIK.17.t:0 "The Democrats' Purge"
 NIK.17.d:0 ""The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov" began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 NIK.17.a:0 "How many could there be?"

 NIK.18.t:0 "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 NIK.18.d:0 "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies were in a state of hysteria. Accusations flew like never before, hostility was palpable, and all worried about the ties of even those persons sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with all eyes weighing up Stalina in disquiet. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually ceased, and some token applause was offered. Most, however, were worried by Stalina admission that a conspiracy as they feared was not beyond her means. Perhaps it would be best not to think on it too deeply."
 NIK.18.a:0 "Ironic."
 NIK.18.b:0 "She isn't wrong."

 NIK.19.t:0 "A Plot!"
 NIK.19.d:0 "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 NIK.19.a:0 "Can we stop it in time?"

 NIK.20.t:0 "A Smoking Gun"
 NIK.20.d:0 ""Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 NIK.20.a:0 "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 NIK.20.b:0 "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 NIK.21.t:0 "Blackmailing the Problem"
 NIK.21.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita. "With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..."Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife - "Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 NIK.21.a:0 "Just what he deserves."

 NIK.22.t:0 "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 NIK.22.d:0 "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 NIK.22.a:0 "He will not be missed."

 NIK.23.t:0 "The Innocent Verdict"
 NIK.23.d:0 ""He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 NIK.23.a:0 "An innocent on our conscience."
 NIK.23.b:0 "Retract the story!"

 NIK.24.t:0 "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 NIK.24.d:0 "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Alexei Kosygin and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Kosygin and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 NIK.24.a:0 "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 NIK.25.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 NIK.25.d:0 "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Komi Republic. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 NIK.25.a:0 "Out with the old?"
 NIK.25.b:0 "Out with the old?"
 NIK.25.c:0 "Out with the old?"

 NIK.26.t:0 "Deprecated"
 NIK.26.d:0 "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Kosygin or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Kosygin blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 NIK.26.a:0 "A new name to learn..."

 NIK.27.t:0 "Kosygin Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.27.d:0 "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Komi Republic. Vowing to steer the republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Komi Republic."
 NIK.27.a:0 "A change for the better?"

 NIK.28.t:0 "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.28.d:0 "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Komi Republic. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 NIK.28.a:0 "Let's see how she does."
 
 NIK.2800.t:0 "Voznesensky Endures!"
 NIK.2800.d:0 "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now."As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands."The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..."Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 NIK.2800.a:0 "How does he survive?"

 NIK.29.t:0 "Discrediting the Leakers"
 NIK.29.d:0 ""Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 NIK.29.a:0 "Truth? It does not matter."

 NIK.30.t:0 "The Party Fades"
 NIK.30.d:0 "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."\n\nThe meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back.\n\n"These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 NIK.30.a:0 "A small price to pay."

 NIK.31.t:0 "The Popularity Debate"
 NIK.31.d:0 "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic parties among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the coalition has become full of worriers and defeatists," the DSNP candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is virtuous - but it is fragile, when faced with extremism and growing disregard for the very foundation of our Republic." Stalina comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists, in the name of preserving our homeland from hatred and tyranny. That is all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Kosygin to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Stalina is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists - the uncommitted citizens who have been unfortunately waylaid by impossible promises - we may be able to draw them into support for democracy. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 NIK.31.a:0 "Voznesensky is correct."
 NIK.31.b:0 "Kosygin has the best argument."
 NIK.31.e:0 "Stalina presents the optimal solution."

 NIK.32.t:0 "The Voznesentsi's Solution"
 NIK.32.d:0 "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan... or rather, the lack of one," he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."
 NIK.32.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.33.t:0 "Soyuz Molodih Reformatorov's Solution"
 NIK.33.d:0 "The applause echoed across the chamber. The debate was over, and now was the hour for choosing what exactly must be done to save the democratic parties from losing their grip on Komi, before it was too late.\n\n"Comrades, the vote will now begin. Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."\n\nWhile the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Kosygin's plan will be put into motion."\n\nAlexei Kosygin is a rational man. While he believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, he also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic parties. Kosygin's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Stalina's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under his hand, democracy shall reach salvation."
 NIK.33.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.34.t:0 "Demokraticheskiy Vybor Rossii's Solution"
 NIK.34.d:0 "Following the debate and usual applause that came with its end, the delegates were asked to vote on the 'winner' of the debate, and in turn, decide the plan that would end the falling popularity of the democratic party.\n\n"Delegates of this dear republic, it is now time to begin our voting for this debate's winner. Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."
 NIK.34.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.35.t:0 "Stalina's Compromise"
 NIK.35.d:0 "After Stalina spoke her closing statement, the clapping of hands - albeit a little forced - echoed in the room. The debate had concluded, and now, the delegates had to make their choice on the course that the party must take to combat falling poll numbers.\n\n"Comrades of Komi, the voting process for the winner of these debates begins now. Please cast your votes."\n\nAfter a moment, the moderator looked at the box. It wasn't even close.\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Stalina's plan has been passed."\n\nStalina is a woman who was determined to defend democracy. In her view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the republic. Anti-extremist measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media" will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And, with this, in her eyes - the republic would be saved."
 NIK.35.a:0 "Let's hope it works."

 NIK.36.t:0 "A Message from Zhdanov"
 NIK.36.d:0 "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short. "I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these." He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 NIK.36.a:0 "You're welcome... comrade?"

 NIK.37.t:0 "Taking the Internal Files"
 NIK.37.d:0 "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 NIK.37.a:0 "What could go wrong?"
 NIK.37.b:0 "We've seen this one before..."

 NIK.38.t:0 "The Informational Arsenal"
 NIK.38.d:0 "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 NIK.38.a:0 "Perfection!"

 NIK.39.t:0 "Better than the Others"
 NIK.39.d:0 "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration."He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 NIK.39.a:0 "Thanks, but no thanks."

 NIK.40.t:0 "Suslov's Secrets"
 NIK.40.d:0 "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his Chief of the General Staff, and Yegor Ligachev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to police around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Comrades Ligachev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile." The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Yuri Andropov, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist Party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union."\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Arvids Pelshe, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 NIK.40.a:0 "A treasure worth any price."

 NIK.41.t:0 "A Plan Foiled?"
 NIK.41.d:0 "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 NIK.41.a:0 "Perhaps we'll never know."

 NIK.42.t:0 "Zhdanov's Favor"
 NIK.42.d:0 "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely." Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-" He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai." Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 NIK.42.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

 NIK.421.t:0 "Reporting for Duty"
 NIK.421.d:0 ""Comrade Oplesnin-..." The phone call failed, a common occurrence in Syktyvkar that the Deputy who once dispatched from the Halls of the Kremlin never quite grew used. Pestered, Zhdanov made another attempt: "Comra-..." This second call ended up sooner than the last one. Zhdanov would rather not make a call in the afternoon when all the few lines available are busy with bureaucrats trying to request papers from their managers. Still, the issue was too important to be postponed, so he dialed again. "Comrade Oplesnin..."\n\n"Comrade Zhdanov, is that you, my old friend?"\n\nOn the other side of the line, there stood a tired old man who seldom left his dacha these days, yet who, throughout the decades, saw more battles than half the Republic's military. General Oplesnin knew what Zhdanov wanted with that call. However, he didn't see himself as fit for action anymore; he had led his life like he led his battalions to the frontlines, marching forward with pride and effort only to be torn apart by enemy artillery. No one could be more tired of combat, pain, and glory. But then his eyes caught sight of his Order of Lenin at the wall, awarded by Zhdanov's hand, and set his mind remembering...\n\nThe triumph of the Revolution would be the only thing great enough to justify it. All that fighting would be a vain waste of many lives, including his own, if not redeemed by putting Russia at the hands of the workers. After some more dialectical confabulation, the general gave his caller what he wanted "Comrade Zhdanov, my life is at the hands of the Party."\n\nNikolai Oplesnin took his old uniform out of the closet and got himself properly dressed. If he would be a soldier again, he should make himself feel like one. His first battle would be against the General Staff's telephone.\n\n"General Nikolai Oplesnin, presenting himself for duty.""
 NIK.421.a:0 ""I am ready for any assignment.""

 NIK.422.t:0 "Nighttime Suspicions"
 NIK.422.d:0 "It was the dark of night when Pyotr Grigorenko, the Republican military's Chief of Staff, telephoned Svetlana Stalina. He had deliberated about the call for some time, worried that she would be disturbed from sleep, and thus unreceptive to his imperative.\n\nHe need not have been. Barely one ring had passed when the call was answered, and the voice all in the Republic knew well answered him decisively. Like himself, Stalina was most active during the nighttime hours, finding them free of distraction and an optimal time to accomplish work. Equally aware of her disdain for wasting time, he got right to the point.\n\nNikolai Oplesnin had been appointed to the Republic's General Staff. His General Staff. And he was most concerned. The man was both qualified and proficient, true, but that was not his worry. Oplesnin's past was. It was impossible to overlook his activities under Bukharin's regime and, thus, his potential ties with the WRRF.\n\nGrigorenko was both surprised and heartened by Stalina's immediate agreement. She shared his concerns, particularly those concerning the absolute necessity of preventing communist infiltration of Republican state organs. Oplesnin had to be watched, closely. They, therefore, quickly came to an agreement of coordination.\n\nIf only the Republic as a whole could be so decisive as Stalina was, Grigorenko thought as he replaced the receiver."
 NIK.422.a:0 "Keep a close watch."

 NIK.43.t:0 "The Chaos Increases"
 NIK.43.d:0 "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!" Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!" "Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?" Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything." "You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 NIK.43.a:0 "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 NIK.43.b:0 "Send them in, mop them up."
 NIK.43.c:0 "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 NIK.44.t:0 "No Need to Panic"
 NIK.44.d:0 "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 NIK.44.a:0 "The problem solves itself."

 NIK.45.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.45.d:0 "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 NIK.45.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.46.t:0 "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 NIK.46.d:0 "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 NIK.46.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.47.t:0 "Embracing the Moderates"
 NIK.47.d:0 "The poll numbers are up, for once."Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 NIK.47.a:0 "Something good comes out of this."

 NIK.48.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.48.d:0 "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 NIK.48.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.49.t:0 "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 NIK.49.d:0 "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 NIK.49.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.50.t:0 "Peace through Superior Firepower"
 NIK.50.d:0 "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 NIK.50.a:0 "Do us proud."

 NIK.51.t:0 "A Cordial Request"
 NIK.51.d:0 "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov" was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the president of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldiers gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 NIK.51.a:0 "Why would we?"
 NIK.51.b:0 "Let's try it, at least."
 
 NIK.52.t:0 "A Propaganda Surge!"
 NIK.52.d:0 "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. "Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the worker's revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots! "\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 NIK.52.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 NIK.53.t:0 "Suspicions within the Party"
 NIK.53.d:0 "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 NIK.53.a:0 "Another trap!"
 
 NIK.54.t:0 "Silver Bullet Holes"
 NIK.54.d:0 "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 NIK.54.a:0 "The only upside..."
 
 NIK.55.t:0 "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 NIK.55.d:0 "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 NIK.55.a:0 "Could it even work?"
 
 NIK.56.t:0 "A Bloodless Victory"
 NIK.56.d:0 "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshares is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."

 NIK.57.t:0 "Silent Contemplation"
 NIK.57.d:0 "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 NIK.57.a:0 "Useful, someday."
 
 NIK.58.t:0 "Svetlana's Theories"
 NIK.58.d:0 "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the president of the republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet ?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Kosygin. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."

 NIK.59.t:0 "A Victory for Publicity"
 NIK.59.d:0 "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door. "Yes, you can enter."The president did so. "Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."The older politician smiled. "Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food.""Only if you pay, Comrade President.""

Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her.

As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly.

Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Vice-President Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."

 NIK.63.d:0 "The three heads of Komi's moderate political parties have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the four men's head. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Vice president Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 NIK.63.a:0 "Placated, for now."
 
 NIK.64.t:0 "A Meeting on the Side"
 NIK.64.d:0 "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Kosygin's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Kosygin would support the young politician's proposal."

He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nKosygin folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Kosygin break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 NIK.65.a:0 "A traitor at the very top...?"
 
 NIK.66.t:0 "Beginning the Investigation"
 NIK.66.d:0 "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Kosygin's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the president of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the president would deny everything. Stalina and Kosygin's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 NIK.66.a:0 "Ask him for answers. Now."
 NIK.66.b:0 "There's no need for confrontation."
 
 NIK.67.t:0 "The Confrontation"
 NIK.67.d:0 "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Kosygin sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 NIK.67.a:0 "Oh?"
 
 NIK.68.t:0 "A Stable Partnership"
 NIK.68.d:0 "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Kosygin. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Kosygin slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the president to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.". The president shook her hand."
 NIK.68.a:0 "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 NIK.69.t:0 "The Conspiracy"
 NIK.69.d:0 "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Kosygin and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Kosygin on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 NIK.69.a:0 "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 NIK.70.t:0 "Approaching the Left"
 NIK.70.d:0 "Stalina's affinity with the social democratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Vice President Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the Social Democrat party to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the president spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 NIK.70.a:0 "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 NIK.71.t:0 "Our Cover Blown!"
 NIK.71.d:0 "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe president casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Kosygin. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Kosygin first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the Liberal Party's leader. Kosygin was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the president and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Vice President Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe president didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 NIK.71.a:0 "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 NIK.71.b:0 "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 
 NIK.72.t:0 "Burying the Dirt"
 NIK.72.d:0 "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Kosygin's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\nIt was all they could do... But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Kosygin of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Kosygin and Stalina."
 NIK.72.a:0 "May it never again arise."
 
 NIK.73.t:0 "Traitors to Democracy?"
 NIK.73.d:0 "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Kosygin had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 NIK.73.a:0 "Can Komi be saved?"
 
 NIK.74.t:0 "A Successful Ploy"
 NIK.74.d:0 "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, Gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 NIK.74.a:0 "Make it so."
 
 NIK.75.t:0 "The Confession"
 NIK.75.d:0 "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Kosygin decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Kosygin's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of the Liberals, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?"once both were alone. Kosygin sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Kosygin began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 NIK.75.a:0 "Is it enough?"
 
 NIK.76.t:0 "The Leak Revealed"
 NIK.76.d:0 "The thought could initially be put aside by Kosygin. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the president and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Kosygin's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the president figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Kosygin didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nKosygin called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 NIK.76.a:0 "How is this possible?"
 
 NIK.77.t:0 "The Eye of the Enemy"
 NIK.77.d:0 "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Kosygin or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Kosygin's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Kosygin's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Kosygin's theory.\n\nKosygin was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the president of being a Zhanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the president that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the president, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or president Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."
 NIK.77.a:0 "Plots and maleficence, everywhere!"
 
 NIK.78.t:0 "Reigning in the Party"
 NIK.78.d:0 "Suslov walked a little easier these days. Even with his legion of spies in the government, it was never simple to determine why exactly the democratic parties did anything they did. Their leaders, although allies and mostly friendly to one another, jealousy hoarded their considerable personal influence. As a result it was a rare event for anyone to claim ownership of an unpopular policy such as ending the pressure on the far left.\n\nNo matter the cause, the end of the war on the far left let Suslov move more easily. Aggressive and ambitious underlings had pressured their boss to move violently against the government and far-right. Now that the bloodshed and propaganda war was over, a lot of Suslov's loyalists were free to crack some skulls and twist some arms to re-establish order. The fact he had calmly weathered the storm gave Suslov a lot of credibility, for now the left stood strong and the government appeared weak."
 NIK.78.a:0 "They will not fall to revisionism."
 
 NIK.79.t:0 "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 NIK.79.d:0 "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the president. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe president listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 NIK.79.a:0 "He's gone too far."
 NIK.79.b:0 "Let's keep this between us..."
 
 NIK.80.t:0 "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 NIK.80.d:0 "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The president watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 NIK.80.a:0 "There will be blood."
 
 NIK.81.t:0 "The Split Front"
 NIK.81.d:0 "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 NIK.81.a:0 "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 
 NIK.82.t:0 "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 NIK.82.d:0 "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 NIK.82.a:0 "Allies across the lines."
 
 NIK.83.t:0 "A Traitor?"
 NIK.83.d:0 "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Kosygin was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the president managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the president must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky. The president was proving himself to be a liability to the democratic cause, and some sense needed to be talked into him... Or imposed at gunpoint, if necessary."
 NIK.83.a:0 "Peace must come first."
 NIK.83.b:0 "We are done with talk."
 
 NIK.84.t:0 "The Militarists' Confrontation"
 NIK.84.d:0 "Voznesensky looked at them benevolently, his eyes rising above a pile of paperwork. "I was told Rodionov would be present, yes?"\n\nKosygin shrugged. "He has a cold today. Voznesensky, we came here today about the ceasefire with the left. This shit can't go on. "The president cocked an eyebrow. "The left is rising in power every day. I can't take an evening walk without bumping into Suslov informants. We've had their paramilitary on the ropes with the campaign against them, and now you let them escape? If we don't destroy them now they'll relieve us of our jobs."\n\nThe president closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, his reply was confident..."
 NIK.84.a:0 "There will be no compromise!"
 NIK.84.b:0 "You see, this was the plan all along..."
 
 NIK.85.t:0 "No Compromise!"
 NIK.85.d:0 ""I understand your concerns. But I'm not budging on this. During our campaign on the communist we began hemorrhaging territory to the far right. We need to crush the fascists if this republic is to last the year. If you have other concerns, feel free to bring them up to me now. Otherwise, this lovely pile of paper requires presidential signatures."\n\nKosygin and Stalina were taken aback. Voznesensky waited expectantly for another round of argument. However, his colleagues stiffly offered him goodbye and left. The president sighed and returned to the task at hand."
 NIK.85.a:0 "What is he hiding?"
 
 NIK.86.t:0 "Voznesensky Folds"
 NIK.86.d:0 "I understand your concerns. But this has just been a temporary plan. Our men are waiting for the communist to surge out against the fascist before we turn on them. From the start I didn't trust the communist to uphold any bargain made. Thus, this method of finishing them off while also repulsing the far right's attack. "\n\n"I see."Kosygin said. Stalina's expression remained difficult to interpret. Was she buying his excuses? "We'll let you to it, Voznesensky. Sorry for bothering you. I might drop by later when the time comes to send the orders to turn on the reds, yes?"\n\n"It would be my pleasure. We'll send the encrypted orders over the radio to our commanders."Said the president, his eyes already back to his tax forms. Kosygin and Stalina left without any further word."
 NIK.86.a:0 "We can all get along, no?"
 
 NIK.87.t:0 "The Leak"
 NIK.87.d:0 "Commander names, streets, positions, hours. The radio broadcast over public frequencies didn't arouse much more than curiosity from the average civilian. But to anyone invested in Komi's great game, the communication was crystal clear. The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."
 NIK.87.a:0 "How could this be?!"
 
 NIK.88.t:0 "The Infiltrators"
 NIK.88.d:0 "The scale of the leak was titanic. To betray the deployment order of every democratic paramilitary, one would need men inside every brigade. This was the only way to break every secret cipher in a single twenty-four hour period.\n\nNot only had Suslov infiltrated the highest level of the democratic parties, the democratic paramilitaries were deeply compromised as well. The government had no secret left to fight back against the far left's puppet master."
 NIK.88.a:0 "A nest of traitors and spies!"
 
 NIK.89.t:0 "All Quiet from Zhdanov"
 NIK.89.d:0 "Voznesensky removed the brick from the wall and rummaged inside the hole. Nothing but his original message attempt.\n\nSince the disastrous radio leak, it had been impossible to reach Zhdanov. None of the usual dead drop locations had seen any activity. Voznesensky was tempted to use the emergency channel they had reserved for immediate communication. But Zhdanov's continued silence communicated a message in itself. The president burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick. Instead of closing up the dead drop, the politician threw the brick as far as he could. The projectile hit a distant lamppost with a loud "thunk". "When has everything gone so goddamn wrong?" Voznesensky thought bitterly."
 NIK.89.a:0 "The final betrayal."
 
 NIK.90.t:0 "Rumors of a Rising Star"
 NIK.90.d:0 "Komi's great game of politics has always ran on a steady diet of rumors. Knowing what one's opponents are doing is crucial if one desires to remain in the game. Of course, filtering out signal from noise is a skill all by itself. Tall tales, baseless speculation and hearsay are common fodder for the various intelligence agencies, and it takes time to sift through everything.\n\nThe latest craze is a rumor that an influential politician from Gorky has travelled the wastes to reach Komi. Depicted as a natural political genius and charismatic orator by the rumor mill, few agree as to what this arrival means. The most popular conclusion is that Suslov, the far left's mastermind, is likely behind it."
 NIK.90.a:0 "Another communist power-player?"
 
 NIK.91.t:0 "The Rise of Ponomaryov"
 NIK.91.d:0 "As it turned out, the man from Gorky was not from Gorky after all! Boris Ponomaryov, as the man's name turned out to be, was born in Shakhovskoye. The small village in what was once Ulyanovsk Oblast, nowadays the KONR controlled Samara government, has another famous child in the form of Mikhail Suslov. An interesting coincidence, perhaps? Few in Komi's shaky democracy would believe this.\n\nWhatever his origins are, the charismatic Ponomaryov has been making the rounds. His speech lambasting the democratic coalition's unwillingness to deal with the far right have been popular through large swathes of the population. This newcomer rides on a wave of discontent, and is likely to be one of the prime communist candidates in the next elections."
 NIK.91.a:0 "Now, what do you hide...?"
 
 NIK.92.t:0 "The Veil"
 NIK.92.d:0 "A charismatic new communist candidate from Suslov's old stomping ground is too much of a coincidence for the democratic coalition's higher ups to swallow. Suslov's command of Komi's far left is ambiguous and hard to measure. Perhaps the slippery shadow might have made a pact with a charismatic front-man to enhance his control of the party?\n\nThe young republic's policemen would of course never stoop so low as to run private investigations on the enemies of the current government. But monitoring the coming and going of new political figures definitely falls somewhere in their priority list. Better, then, to run some background checks on this new figure."
 NIK.92.a:0 "We must pierce it!"
 NIK.92.b:0 "There is no point."
 
 NIK.93.t:0 "A Revelation"
 NIK.93.d:0 "The detectives were dismayed to find that in the end Ponomaryov was... terribly dull.\n\nA paper pusher in Suslov's foreign ministry during the West Russian War, Ponomaryov fell of the face of the earth during the ensuing collapse and anarchy. Not too surprising, as the front's disintegration had seen tons of people claim authority in those first few years of the anarchy.\n\nThe man reappeared a few year laters when the situation had stabilized. Through fragmented communication Ponomaryov had managed to reach out to his old boss Suslov. As the man still resided in the WRRF's territory, it seems that Komi's communist had told him to stay there as a liaison agent with the WRRF's officer clique. A few years passed before Suslov recalled him back home. Upon arrival in Komi's capital, Ponomaryov had begun his political efforts.\n\nOutside of his speeches, Ponomaryov was a terminally boring man. Nothing more than another Suslovite automaton it seemed.\n\nThe police continued their investigation. Perhaps a few more scraps of dirt could be gathered on him. For matters of state security, of course."
 NIK.93.a:0 "Just another puppet..."
 
 NIK.94.t:0 "The Trail Fades"
 NIK.94.d:0 "Ponomaryov's private life was filled with scandals, as it turned out. When drinking with his friends, he often skipped paying for his round of drinks. Last year, a terrible cold had left him stuck at home for a week, and rumor had it that a local young woman with pretty clothes had brought him soup for the week.\n\nWell, not terribly important scandals. The police investigators were running out of leads on him. And in Syktyvkar, being too nosy could always carry an unexpected price. The far left's counter-intelligence agencies had likely expected the police to come sniffing around their man. Pushing too hard would not be a good look for the supposedly impartial governmental officers.\n\nThe police thus ended its inquiry. Boris Ponomaryov was just another communist politician hopeful. The government had other business to tend to. Hopefully the newcomer was not dangerous."
 NIK.94.a:0 "This must be Suslov's doing!"
 
 NIK.95.t:0 "Increased Fascist Activity"
 NIK.95.d:0 "Komi's far right had always been a force to be reckoned with. Not as big as the government's democratic militias, nor as big as Suslov's web of far-left nogoodniks, the fascist militias had still maintained a respectable fighting strength. Drilling their men frequently and accumulating as many weapons as possible, the far right had earned their place as the third pillar of Komi's defense forces.\n\nFrom there, the fascist paramilitaries had adapted themselves well to the stalemate. They acquired a few quarters of the capital for their own purposes, and often clashed with democrats or communists. Their big break had been given to them by the government's recent battles with Suslov's forces. Under garrisoned communist or democratic districts had been taken over by the far right. Weapon convoys rolled between various fascist sectors as every area the far right got its hands on was reinforced by fresh militiamen.\n\nIn parallel to the military offensive had come a propaganda offensive. The democrat's pathetic attempt at crushing the decadent far left would come back to haunt Komi, the radio announcer claimed. Had the communist not squandered two opportunities to defeat the Germans already? The democratic coalition was impotent to stop the spread of the communist blight. Only hard men could manage these difficult times. The take over of new areas by fascist militias was only preventive, meant to save citizens from the communist menace. So went the far right's propaganda campaign."
 NIK.95.a:0 "Where one falls, another rises."
 
 NIK.96.t:0 "Left-Voznesentsi Threaten to Split!"
 NIK.96.d:0 ""This is an outrage! Even as a rising tide of fascism threatens to drown the republic, the government insists on fighting the communist? Has President Voznesensky gone mad? Or is he merely capitulating to the fear mongers of the liberal and conservative party?"\n\nThe speech was booed by the majority of the democratic party. But a worrying percentage of the social democratic representatives cheered the speech. The majority of the social democrats' left wing had been grumbling for weeks now that the fascists were left free to rampage. Now the grumbling had ended and an openly mutinous feeling had swept through the left of the Voznesensti. Rumors of a motion to end the campaign on the far left had spread through the assembly. Worryingly, rumors of mass defections to the communists had also begun spreading. The social democrats were the biggest party of the ruling coalition. Yet the loss of the party's left wing would not be good for Voznesensky's party. A loss of the majority that allowed the coalition to rule the nation would likely follow, and with that the specter of a paralyzed government unable to deal with any crisis."
 NIK.96.a:0 "An absurd demand!"
 
 NIK.97.t:0 "A Hanging Thread?"
 NIK.97.d:0 "Voznesensky's party whips had been working overtime to put the fear of God into the mutineers. As it turned out, all this effort risked being for naught.\n\nAlarms were first raised when the social democrats' left wingers refused any attempt at compromise. Several representatives that had once been open to compromise with the center and center right had now turned into hardliners. No amount of threats, negotiations or bribes could coerce them back into line. The increasingly suspicious party whips turned to less official channels. The party members' phone lines were tapped, just as paramilitary agents tracked the mutineers every moves. Eventually a pattern began to emerge: almost half of the mutineers were receiving instructions directly from Suslov and his communists!\n\nThis development has turned the mutiny crisis into a looming catastrophe. The communists had planted a hard kernel of dissenters within the social democrats for just such an eventuality. As the social democrat's left wing is riddled with Suslovite agents and those gullible enough to follow them, it is impossible to negotiate with them. The government's loss of its majority has now become imminent."
 NIK.97.a:0 "Everyone is compromised!"
 
 NIK.98.t:0 "The Olive Branch"
 NIK.98.d:0 "Zhdanov felt a little apprehensive, writing his letter. There was always a thrill, a slight pang of fear upon jumping into the unknown. His partnership with Voznesensky had been friendly all these years. It had been comfortable to slowly build up the republic as well as develop its communist party. But now the movements of Gumilyov, Suslov and the democratic war hawks required Zhdanov to step up his own game. Thus, his declaration of war as a request for peace.\n\nPresident Voznesensky would receive a humble proposal of peace. Would it not be better if the enemies of reaction united their forces to smash the fascist paramilitaries? The end of the government's assault on the communist paramilitaries would prevent the fascist from gaining strength. It would also safeguard the left's own manpower, for Zhdanov enjoyed knowing the communists held significant firepower. One day, perhaps Suslov's grip would be wrenched away from the paramilitaries, and their ownership would transfer to Zhdanov? This development would have to wait, however. Before that would come the division of the democratic party, as the liberals and conservatives would lash out against the social democrats for letting the communists go free. Voznesensky would be a victim of his attempt to broker peace with the left.\n\nIn this regard, the president might choose to reject peace. It would be a clever move, and the president was a clever man. Voznesensky would never suspect that his old mentor and long time associate would dare burn up their partnership and reveal the president's ties to the left. Such a revelation would of course immensely hurt the president. But Zhdanov suspected he wouldn't even have to go this far. After all, that wily snake Suslov had many trump cards of his own. Better let Suslov engineer a collapse of the government. This way, Zhdanov would keep his very best cards for a few more turns. The winner of the game, after all, might very well be the last man to make a move."

The man imagined he had some level of functional cleverness if nothing else, for leading men on the battlefield required the ability to outthink the opponent as well as outfight him. Sure, Boris would never be a published author, but as the commander of one of the largest democratic paramilitaries he spent his days trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition in tactics and strategies.\n\nAfter days spent hammering communist positions and wracking his brain on how best to outflank various pockets of resistance, the commander couldn't understand where his new orders were coming from. The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities. "We were on the brink of ending the communists. " the commander informed the messenger. Not as a reproach, but rather as a statement of facts. The messenger, a young man with a scraggly beard, nodded. Boris could see that his interlocutor, too, was confused by the switch of priorities. But orders were orders. 'twas not for Boris and his ilk to question them. The commander hoped his men would understand, lest things become mutinous."

But the communist politician knew that the easy days were over.\n\nThe first order of business was to sever some more... problematic ties with the President. Zhdanov had long exchanged information and other goodies with his partner as continuous proofs of good will. Now this trade would have to be cut back, to keep the pressure on. The usual methods of communication would also be adjusted, aside from a few emergency channels. Voznesensky would soon see that the old days of continuous access to one another were a thing of the past.\n\nThese few acts of housekeeping done, all Zhdanov could do was wait. He was fairly certain Suslov would come up with a solution to the current fruitless battle between the communists. Voznesensky was a fool if he thought the status quo could continue endlessly, in Komi's endless games of political espionage. The president might one day be shocked to learn that his democratic coalition is not as secure as he'd like."

Worryingly, almost all were members of the left wing of Voznesensky's social democrats. Party whips were also conspicuously absent the entire morning. In the back corridors of the legislative assembly, the democratic faction's insiders exchanged urgent whispers about the situation.\n\nIn the afternoon the missing deputies came in after the lunch break. Without a word, the men and women of the assembly picked up their chairs and offices and dragged them to the communist side of the assembly. The rain of jeers and boos from their former democratic colleagues did nothing to hinder their progress. The far right and far left observed the situation carefully. A few communists exchanged written memos, but none spoke publicly. Once the commotion was dealt with and order was restored to the assembly, the democratic coalition's majority no longer existed. While neither the communists nor the fascists made a big case of it, the government now lived on borrowed time. At any moment a vote of no confidence could go through to bring down the previously impervious democratic coalition."

The gas flames licked the kettle, rendering it red hot in the badly lit communal kitchen. Inside the steel kettle, pressure was rising to a fevered pitch.\n\nThe abandon of the Social Democratic party by its left wing had brought Komi's fragile status quo to the brink. Now pressure was welling up within the legislative assembly as the democratic coalition desperately searched for a pathway to a new majority. Zhdanov had not heard of Voznesensky since the sudden betrayal. It was not difficult to imagine where the president's mind was at the moment. Rage at being undercut by the communists. Anguish at the thought of his ties with Zhdanov coming to light. Now might be the best moment for Zhdanov to push against the President, to weaken him further before the left could bring a final breakdown of the coalition. By threatening a full reveal of their connection, Zhdanov could try to extract some concession or another, such as a tax free communist district. This would further weaken the President and estrange him from his allies. But the communist politician knew that Voznesensky was a proud man, and was equally likely to resist any further attempt at blackmail. That might prove another worthwhile scenario, for if the president refused further cooperation with Zhdanov he might not live the week politically. Zhdanov surmised that the social democrat's allies would not remain allies for long of a president that had brought their government to the abyss.\n\nThe kettle's whistle brought Zhdanov out of his reverie. Yes, his former protege was stuck in a pressure chamber of his own making. The least that Zhdanov could do was to bring him out of it at the first opportunity... Or at least, do so when it would be most profitable to Zhdanov's own ascension to the top."

Most enraged of all were his allies in the democratic coalition: the remaining social democrats, suddenly realizing the cause of their party's downfall; Shafarevich's conservatives, our erstwhile allies, unnerved by the idea of communists worming their way into the government; and most of all Kosygin's liberals, livid at the betrayal. The chief of the liberal party has gone on the warpath upon hearing of the leaks, promising a vote of no-confidence to oust the traitor president. Any protest that doing so would hand a significant amount of power to the communist have been brushed aside by Kosygin and his allies.

In disgrace, Voznesensky saw his presidency revoked and was forced to cede power to Kosygin, his former second in command. Komi's constitution is quite clear about the chain of succession for executive power. The downfall of Voznesensky means the ascension of Kosygin.\n\nIf book makers weren't sure about betting on the downfall of the former President, money is already being put on the lifespan of the new presidency. For all his energetic speech urging the removal of Voznesensky, Kosygin has not given any response to those who worry about the fragility of the democratic coalition. Shorn of the social democrat's left wing, and with his contempt of the communists on display, the new president must quickly find a way of stabilizing his political backing, lest the same fate befalls him.\n\nhis political reputation as a neutral leader of order and stability destroyed, and his political party collapsing, Voznesensky's political career is finished.

A last minute surge of support by the far right brought in support for President Voznesensky. This support has added to the surprising amount of support the far left has given the President. Yes, Voznesensky has proven to be an enemy of the common worker... But Kosygin has done nothing but encourage the democratic coalition to ramp up the war against the left. The communist leaders thus left individual members of parliament free to vote. As such a surprising grouping of deputies have let Voznesensky cling to power.\n\nThe leader of the liberal party has answered with a speech about the ignominy of staying in power through fascist and communist votes. Kosygin has urged vigilance to all members of the democratic coalition, lest radical agenda slip through Voznesensky's presidential orders. In a speech of his own, a visibly shaken Voznesensky has thanked the republic for its continued confidence in him. The President went on to urge cooperation in these difficult time. The president's speech was bereft of its usual crisp and decisive flavor, much as Voznesensky's government itself has been hollowed out of any real base of support."

"Your cooperation on the tax exemption deal is much appreciated. I will uphold my end of the bargain."\n\nVoznesensky tossed the crumpled memo into the fireplace. His old mentor had now turned into a merciless jailor. What choice did the president have but collaboration with Zhdanov? Without the social democrat's majority in the chamber, Voznesensky had entered a very precarious position. Any hint to the rest of the democratic coalition that he was compromised by communist deals would see them throw him out into the streets.\n\nThe president pushed the food away.

Many politicized youths join the army to learn the art of violence, only to seek further employment in the militias after their tour of service. Others join the army in between stints in the streets of the capital, often to let the heat die down after a recent militia clash.\n\nToday a group of communist leaning soldiers have announced an unlimited strike to protest the government's violence against the far left. "Why has the government gone back on its words and broken the truce with the communist parties? Why are noble men of the republican army sent to die for political bickerings?" asked the speakers to assembled soldiers. A chorus of indignation lifted up the question, as policemen observed the public protest.\n\nNumbers are still coming in, but it seems that our initial guess that one third of the army has communist leanings has proven accurate. Down to sixty-six percent of its usual strength, and with all of its tank corps joining the strike, our army has been badly hit by this strike."

Attempts by communist paramilitaries to support the strikers were fought off violently. After a day of bloody battles, the strikers were dishonorably discharged and sent home without pay.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this has hurt the communist in any real way, as the soldiers have simply flooded into their old paramilitary units. The tanks themselves have rolled away from the army bases and into their storage depots near the communist headquarters. No attempt was made to prevent this, the government fearing rampaging tankers turning their guns on Syktyvkar's buildings.

These protests have been drowned out in turn by a tidal wave of outrage from parties ranging from social democrats to the far right. "The communists thugs have deserted their posts in this hour of need" pointed out a fascist deputy, to a mixture of applause and jeers.\n\nThe fascist paramilitaries are known to maintain their own strict standards of training and obedience.

The government's protest that this has proven out to be an unworkable deal in the long run has fallen on deaf ears. These new soldiers insist they are loyal to the government, and consider their demands for more autonomy as a proof of trust of the government in them.\n\nGovernmental intelligence sources have tried to decipher the far right's communication. Many higher-ups of the democratic coalition suspect Lev Gumilyov, shadow master of the far right to be behind this recent agitation.

And through all this, the regiment's officers were slowly being shuffled around. An apolitical colonel decided on an early retirement. His replacement was a well known ultra-nationalist. Little by little, the grievances of the former paramilitaries simply went away, solved on their own by the military command's bureaucracy.\n\nDemocratic politicians are now pouring resources into the issue. Has the far right penetrated the military's high command? Or as it simply been a case of Gumilyov spreading bribes to get things to go his way? Either situation are deeply unsettling to the democratic parties. Perhaps the government has traded Suslov's Charibdis for Gumilyov's Scylla."

Now that his supporters hold a non trivial position in the republican army, Shafarevich's political star, as tainted as it is by his associated to Gumilyov, has risen sharply.\n\nHis temporary associates in the democratic coalition have not reacted much to this new reality, as the military is, supposedly, a politically neutral organization. However, in Komi a ministerial reshuffle is never far away, and a new conservative ministry might go a long way toward reaching out to the government's new partner.\n\nCommunist politicians, on the other hand, have not been happy to see the rightists gain new supporters. Rumors on the left is that the so-called 'traditional democratic' militias are secretly filled with fascist and Gumilyovites.

Her competence, her as daughter of General Secretary Bukharin, and her friendly, polite demeanor all made her popular within the Communist Party itself. She had become most popular amongst the younger politicians and the reformists, but she also lacked any major opponents within the Party.

Of course, Suslov's job was not merely to do administrative work, but to support those in the party whomst he saw fit so that the party as a whole could grow.\n\nTo his expectations, Bukharina had made quite a splash in the party. Being the daughter of the old General Secretary tended to do that, after all. Suslov had also expected Bukharina to push her more reformist ideas. However, what he did not expect was just how popular Bukharina's ideas would be. Not only did it appeal to those in the Communist Party, but to a surprising amount of those outside the party as well. She leveraged her influence very well, it seemed. Despite the flagrant revisionism that he suspected to lie within her, such an opportunity could not be wasted, as the party always needed more influence in its struggle against the fascists and the liberals. More resources would have to be moved to the "legitimate" side of electoral politics, which meant more could be invested towards supporting Bukharina's popular movement.\n\nSuslov leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea. Of course, he would keep a careful eye on her and her efforts. It would not do any good for him to overly invest into what could turn out to be a foolish endeavour, and if she proved to be a threat, he could hopefully eliminate her before her ideological deviations grew out of hand."

She was quickly becoming a leading figure of the reformists within the Communist Party, closet-revisionists whose influence Suslov had attempted to limit in the past. Bukharina was ambitious, and Suslov had determined long ago, in the offices of the Front, that such people were not reliable.\n\nPandering to electorialist tendencies, an eternal thorn in the side of Suslov, was not the correct path - regardless of the talents of Bukharina and her associates - or the connections of Zhdanov and his "visionary" social club. To bend to bourgeois democracy to resolve a crisis that had been brought to the party by revolutionary methods was non-viable.\n\nSatisfied, Suslov reached for the dull grey phone on the desk, calling the number he had long memorized. Police would be bribed, newspapers would be stolen, and Radio Pravda would release a new spin on the crisis by nightfall.

A choice faced her, one that she would have to abide by for the foreseeable future - that of its recipient.\n\nTwo obvious candidates ran through her mind - Andropov and Zhdanov - a Suslovite and a reformist - of sorts. Andropov was a stretch and a risk - but a very valuable ally, provided the cooperation that he had carried out earlier held evidence towards his true leanings. Zhdanov was an obvious choice, but he was notoriously erratic and populist - and, in a way, Bukharina simply didn't trust him as much as she could.\n\nWith a moment's contemplation, and a look at the notes on her desk, she began to fill in the address line."

Andropov, ever the loyal - if enigmatic - agent, had reported to him as he had on all other nights one stormy evening; but when Suslov asked him about Svetlana Bukharina, the hesitation before he spoke, his pre-made file on her, dismissing her as a threat and suggesting Suslov should turn his eyes elsewhere?\n\nThat was alarming.\n\nSomething told Suslov that the man was compromised, likely accepting some bribe or promise of power by Bukharina. The thought of such a betrayal made Suslov's blood curl - this wasn't Bukharin's runt's party - it was Suslov's.\n\nThe worst part was the lack of material evidence. Andropov seemed as loyal as ever, on the surface - the papers arrived on time, and the reports remained meticulous - but something felt wrong, and Suslov was rarely wrong about these things.

As much as he hated to admit it, it indulged a certain feeling of power to manipulate the two-dimensional surrogates of his colleagues and subordinates as he wove his plans together.\n\nWith all of his contacts, personal relationships, and...other leverage, he could fairly easily determine who would be the next Communist Party candidate for President of the Komi Republic. He skimmed through the assemblage, intermittently striking some figures off the list outright as being too ambitious. Others were, in Suslov's estimation, too powerful in their own right. And then, of course, there were those who had certain ...deviant ideas regarding the party's direction.\n\nIn ordinary times, he would not have resorted to this - but the recent crisis had caused too chaos within the Party to be ignored. The final two photographs lay on his desk in front of him, with meticulously marked notes below each one - a man and a woman, both altogether too-powerful Party members that he could not afford to lose.\n\nChecking the notes, he lifted hs pen once more, and made his final decision. He could only hope that this small act of trust would not be his downfall."

Because of this, the place was almost universally assumed to be bugged. Of course, no one wanted to actually admit this, since any party's leveling of this allegation would be immediately met by a litany of their own misdeeds, so it was generally in everyone's interest to handle all public matters in the ballroom and do all the actual negotiating in the vacant lot behind the hotel.\n\nThe sharp clap of a worn gavel brought the room to order as Mikhail Suslov walked onstage, taking his place at a podium in the center of a long table of allegedly important party figures. Of course, Suslov had put almost every single one of them there, and had a means to keep them in line. Which is precisely what made his current task so irritating.\n\n"Comrades, I am pleased to announce that the Komi Communist Party's Presidential candidate for the upcoming elections is Svetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina."\n\nLoud applause, the flashes of cameras, and cheers rippled across the crowd as the Bukharina strode up the aisle, with just the right sort of smile for the occasion - not overly enthusiastic, but still clearly pleased. Suslov exchanged a quick handshake with her onstage, and, with an almost fearful feeling in the back of his mind, went on for a few minutes about how bright the Republic's future would be following the victory of their new candidate.\n\nInside, of course, Suslov's feelings were quite different. He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. As he stepped back and watched Bukharina work the crowd, addressing union men and council chairs by name, Suslov knew this had to be nipped in the bud before it grew out of control. The fact that both of them privately agreed on a number of issues made no difference. Bukharina would have to calm her patently inflammatory rhetoric, or become a footnote in history. There was simply no alternative - and Suslov wouldn't have it any other way."

Suslov barely took notice, dispensing two cups' worth of tea from the samovar in the corner and lighting a practically-ancient oil lamp. "Svetlana Nikolaevna," he intoned to the woman sitting on the other side of his neatly organized desk, "Your name carries a great deal of importance in this party. Your father, for all his flaws -"\n\n"Mikhail, while I appreciate the flattery," Bukharina said coolly. "I know you haven't called me here to talk about my family name."\n\nSuslov smiled, as if his guest had lived up to his expectations. "Of course. Comrade Bukharina," he began. "Zhdanov has his sights on me and the political order I have created. What I am asking of you is to work with me to keep him in line." Bukharina eyed him warily, not reacting. "I shall not speak in terms of personal loyalty – I know you, and you know me. We are both above such posturing. I would not be surprised if Zhdanov has already made some sort of proposal to you, and if he has not, I envision he shall soon."\n\n"And, comrade General Secretary?"\n\n"I would simply like to reiterate what should be a self-evident truth: Zhdanov will dispose of you and your associates the instant I am gone. The man desires-"\n\n"You dare to suggest that you're any different?"\n\n"Svetlana Nikolaevna, you know how I operate." Suslov paused, sipping tea. "I am not one for leading from the front. Why do you think you have advanced this far in a party with this much anti-Bukharinite sentiment? Goodwill alone? Your family name? I need people at my side."\n\nInternally, Bukharina had to acknowledge he was right, at least in part. She had been the recipient of Suslov's patronage time and time again. "So what would be saying is that I have a choice between being a puppet under you - and dead under Zhdanov."\n\n"Cruder terminology than I would have used, but directionally correct, Comrade Bukharina. You have a simple choice." Suslov put the teacup down. "Stay the course and continue your meteoric and unexpected rise to power, or throw away everything that has gotten you this far for the privilege of being executed by our dear friend Andrei the moment he sees no more use for you.""

Come in, sit down."\n\n"Then you're a very smart woman indeed," Zhdanov noted with obvious insincerity, declining to take a seat but closing the door behind him.

You can't live as Suslov's pawn forever–"\n\n"That's an awfully bold statement from someone asking for help," Svetlana noted with a not-so-subtle hint of tactically-induced irritation.\n\n"I can hear it in your voice, Bukharina. You know it's true."\n\n"Our relationship is hardly one of dependence and subordination," Bukharina countered calmly, her voice suddenly placid and professional.

Even Voznesensky's office was something of a wreck, with countless economic charts and graphs pinned to the wall with a variegated array of metal pushpins and other sharp objects.\n\nYet Voznesensky's demeanor could not have been more to the contrary. Although he scarcely cut an authoritative figure in his plaid sport-coat and bow tie, he nonetheless carried the serene, softly dominant aura of a Persian satrap, watching his numerous aides and underlings with a dispassionate eye.\n\n"Nikolai, I thought we would be speaking privately," Zhdanov said with slight irritation.\n\n"My apologies for the dust, Andrei. The upcoming elections have our headquarters in...disarray," Voznesensky explained. "Only physically, of course," he quickly added. Zhdanov's host motioned to an adjacent, empty, conference room. Voznesensky waited until his guest was seated to direct the conversation to the nebulous 'business' Zhdanov was so keen to discuss in private.\n\n"To put it simply, Nikolai," Zhdanov said, "I'm asking for your backing in the settling of a political score." These words alone didn't take Voznesensky by surprise, it was the name that came next that did. Mikhail goddamned Suslov.\n\n"With all due respect, Andrei...I don't see how this concerns our party. All concerns of practicality or wisdom aside, this is an internal matter for your party. Suslov's goons are a non-entity for us."\n\n"You're very quick to deny the existence of half of your own party's membership," Zhdanov shot back in a retort he'd been practicing in his head for longer than he really wanted to admit. A half-second later, his host acknowledged him with an eye-roll.\n\n"Do I really need to list the reasons your party would benefit from taking Suslov out of the equation?"\n\nVoznesensky was much too self-conscious to respond verbally, but nodded with understanding.\n\n"What kind of support are you looking for?""

Svetlana felt like something out of a cartoon - an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, each stridently pleading their case into her ears. Except in this case, neither was an angel, and both were probably lying.\n\nThe phone rang a second time.\n\nSuslov, on the one hand, was arguably the safe bet. He was, after all, the puppetmaster of the whole Republic. But the red maestro's sickeningly self-assured words gnawed at her.\n\n"Directionally correct."\n\nAs much as she hated to acknowledge it, Zhdanov was not entirely wrong, and, despite her better impulses, his words had gotten to her. The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger.

And, as the actors launched into a rousing chorus with a crescendo of the theater's antique organ, the creaking of steps announced the presence of a visitor for Suslov, the Red Eminence of Komi.\n\nIt certainly wasn't a world-class performance of Boris Godunov that was being put on, Svetlana Bukharina mused as she climbed the rickety stairs to the Komi Grand Theater's lone luxury box parting a thin miasma of bluish cigarette smoke\n\n"To what do I owe the honor, Svetlana Nikolaevna?" Suslov intoned, his voice barely audible over the opera's musical clamor.\n\nBukharina did not respond, letting the tramp of further footsteps on the stairs and a stern look do the talking for her. Six hard-faced paramilitaries filed in behind her as the orchestra below unknowingly sounded a requiem for Komi's puppetmaster.\n\nAnd as his bodyguards shot him a look of sad resignation and holstered their weapons, Suslov knew that this time, he'd been outmaneuvered.\n\n"Comrade General Secretary," Bukharina began curtly, "I think it's time we have a talk." Suslov thought for a moment, running through possible scenarios, and forced a chuckle, regaining a bit of his confidence. He gestured to the militiamen. "I will be honest, Svetlana, I expected better of you."\n\nSvetlana looked right back at him. There was no mercy in those eyes. "As did I. Now, I think we should step out for a moment."\n\n"And for what reason would I do that?"\n\n"Because," hissed a voice from the stairwell. Andrei Zhdanov stepped into the box, flanked by Chelomei and Voytukevich. "I don't think you have a choice."\n\n"My, you people are quite efficient," remarked Suslov, verbally backtracking as he tried to buy time. But age had taken its toll. He had nowhere to run, no backup plan. His bodyguards had been paid off. He fumbled at his pants, trying to draw the pistol he barely knew how to use, but the advancing militiamen were faster, tackling him to the ground and sending his gun clattering across the floor.\n\nSvetlana let a slight smile cross her face.

Despite the blood running from his nose and the newly-acquired grime on his suit, Svetlana had to admit that Suslov still cut a striking figure as he examined his captor with disdain.\n\n"So what exactly shall I be forced to agree to?" Suslov sneered. "Surrendering my position? Declaring you Tsarina?"\n\n"Don't you even start with that," Bukharina scolded. "You've known me for long enough to know exactly what I want you to know."\n\n"A naked power grab, then. I shouldn't have expected much from the product of Nikolai's affair with his own secretary," Suslov hissed.\n\nBukharina bent over and slid her prisoner's gun into her gloved hand, screwing on a suppressor. Suslov's eyes widened with fear as she raised it, racking the slide. Pandemonium erupted in the box as Suslov writhed at his handcuffs, shouting breathlessly while Bukharina's men grabbed Zhdanov, and pulled him back towards the railing. The lead soloist launched into an aria, the orchestral accompaniment resounding throughout the hall. Chelomei shouted something, holding his boss back, both helplessly adrift in the ruins of their own plan.\n\nWithout so much as a word, Svetlana glanced over her shoulder at Zhdanov and put a bullet in her co-conspirator's head."

A van that, Suslov noticed with no lack of bitter amusement, was registered on his own orders. The pen in his hand twitched as he read through the list again, a cold feeling churning in his gut.\n\nLimitations on the power of General Secretary, an election for the position within three years, a freeze on party purges, an end to interference in local soviets' affairs. All unthinkable on their own - but combined, they formed a crushing, black wall that he could barely tolerate to look at.\n\nHe looked up at his former allies, who sat on the opposite side of the van. Bukharina's stare seemed to penetrate through him as if he wasn't there. He tried to send a glare back, but he couldn't muster it. There was something within him that he had not felt in a long time - resigned defeat. He opened his mouth to speak, the words as ash in his mouth. He knew that he sounded hurt. He couldn't help it.\n\n"I am... surprised that you allowed me to keep my membership within the Party, despite your commitment to stripping me of every ability that I have to keep this organization coherent," he managed. "Do you wish for a puppet, then? A reminder of your triumph?" He practically spat out the words, as he signed the paper.\n\nBukharina's gaze met his, utterly unsympathetic, as she spoke a single sentence.

She didn't want to be seen like this - not even by her pet.\n\nThe vision flickered through her mind again, and again, and again. An impulsive shot - the red mist exiting her old coworker's head, the light vanishing from his eyes in an instant. The sound of his dropping, Suslov staring at her impassively, the mad dash to the van through hidden corridors as sirens rang out in the distance. It repeated like the wail of the air-raid sirens that rang out whenever a German bomber decided to take a risk and go for the city's suburbs.\n\nShe looked down at the black blazer that she was wearing, accentuated by a crimson scarf. Blood-red - the same color that had escaped into the air after she pulled the trigger. The color of the people's flag. As she lay there on her back, staring at the crack in the ceiling that she wasn't home enough to patch, she tried to collect her thoughts. Regroup, refocus, repress the memory. Think of something else, anything else.\n\nHer stream of conscience was interrupted by a slight weight on her chest, and the feeling of tiny claws. The red-feathered, black-beaked countenance of her bird, perched atop the breast pocket of her blazer, looked right into her eyes, his head cocked to the side. She remembered feeding him a worm, and the quick snap of his beak. She smiled sadly, and spoke aloud for the first time since she had shot Andrei."

Of course, nothing prevents the Passionariyy militants to rely on their own forces, finding their own ways to trick the subpassionarian mobs, but an easier option appears to be aligning with the monarchist fighters of Sergey Taboritsky. They are a violent, cold-hearted folk who fanatically believe in their chieftain Taboritsky and his preachings about the second coming of the Tsar, and the rumors about the low character of Sergey Vladimirovich are familiar to every soul in the city.

He did not have close ties with Gumilyov and his supporters, but if this man was reaching out to him with this letter, there is opportunity to consider. Although there were real differences of opinion and purpose, he didn't want to waste any assistance extended to his own cause. If successful, the coming tsarevich would be delighted at the results.

"Russia's nature is one not of Bolshevik or Tsar, but one of a diverse collection of pieces that fit together into a larger puzzle. What the Tsar couldn't do, and what the Bolsheviks refused to do is transform Russia into something greater than what it was and has ever been."\n\nAfter taking a moment to gauge how positive the audience reaction had been, he continued, "The future of Russia lay not with the red demagogues or tsarist nobility, but with unity between all Russians, including those who have been wrongfully denied their place as proper Russians, the Turks, the Tatars and Mongols." One of his aides would signal that it was time to end his speech, which he would reluctantly oblige.\n\n"God bless you all, I'm sure we will all meet again very soon." Stepping off the stage, Gumilyov felt the effects of his speech immediately, with the crowd descending into a flurry of cheers and claps.

Once again, his allies desperately tried to convince him. In the end, he reluctantly accepted, if only to help the image of him and the coalition in general.\n\nIn the next days, the government spread the news: a program to showcase Komi culture, preserve their traditions and support them in solving their communal problems will be initiated by the governing coalition.

Last night, we received tape recordings from a source that would like to remain anonymous, and contain excerpts of private dialogues made between the President and some of his party associates, even including prominent faces of the Center Coalition we are all familiar with. Why don't we hear them?"\n\nVoznesensky's voice was heard, slightly corrupted: "... the Komi, the damn Komi! Do you have any idea how much this messes up our plans? We can't (corrupted), and that is all because of the damn natives. They're communists, I tell you, traitors to the country, all of them! One day we'll deal with the problem they are for our Republic!"\n\n"And that's what I call a damn interesting recording! In light of the recent developments, it makes Voznesensky all the more hypocritical: publicly supporting a program to help the natives, yet insulting them indiscriminately behind closed doors? Let us hear your thoughts, listeners!""

 NIK.146.t:0 "The Paradox"
 NIK.146.d:0 "Reports from our government officials and associates talk regarding the program to gain the support of the native voting base, while mostly positive, show it has not been a clear success. As for the program itself, it was pulled off almost perfectly, going without a hitch. Many Komi welcomed the opportunity to receive help by the government and seem supportive of the new policy.\n\nIn general, some seem convinced by this, but despite this small boost in the popularity of the Social Democrats and the Coalition, it would be a lie to say we are fully satisfied with the results. The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy. It seems that this was not the help we are looking for to gain support in our struggle against the left and right."

Organized by the groups aimed at the preservation of Komi culture and tradition, some endorsed by the government, it has been a massive success.\n\nThe festival is located in one of the capital's major parks, in one of the safest neighborhoods, which has helped it avoid any paramilitary clashes. Many Komi took the opportunity to help in the festival, by participating in the exhibitions of anything from traditional clothes, to customs and music. The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers. Many Russian citizens of Syktyvkar were actually ignorant of the Komi lifestyle and culture, and found this as a fascinating opportunity to educate themselves on it. Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."

 NIK.148.t:0 "A History of Our Republic"
 NIK.148.d:0 "One of the most well-known authors in the Komi Republic, Viktor Smirnov, who is in fact an ethnic Komi, has recently released one of his most popular books, "A History of our Republic". The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. The History of the Republic has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Rusians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."
 NIK.148.a:0 "We must know where we come from."
 
 NIK.149.t:0 "The Party's Composition"
 NIK.149.d:0 "One inevitability of Komi's politics is that the status quo will change radically, at a moment's notice. The sadness of this factor, however, is that, at the moment, the status quo seems to be shifting radically away from the ruling Voznesensti faction.\n\nLike it or not, by simple virtue of being the public face of the democratic factions in the Republic, public support has been eroded by scandal after scandal, be they real or constructed by our political enemies. Public support, ever fleeting and ephemeral, has, as of late, been shifting either to the Suslovite extreme left, or the more moderate liberal and conservative factions - those of our coalition partners.\n\nAs our coalition seems to undergo a period of self-restructuring, it is critical to ensure that political capital is more or less maintained by the ruling party, and that the current President isn't challenged too heavily by our own allies. Whether the solution to this is limiting our most credible coalition partner, or simply standing by and letting our power shrivel away, is entirely up to the whims of the President."

 NIK.150.t:0 "A Conversation with Stalina"
 NIK.150.d:0 "Vosnesensky sips at his tea. It's a little sweet for his taste, but he keeps the smile hanging as he faces the cool-faced Stalina. It's always good to keep a little contrast with conversational partners, in any case. Helps with the banter. Not that there's much to talk about these days, besides the endless politics of the Republic. Teacup arrangements as the storm of Russia rages on around them.\n\n"Do you miss the old days, then? Svetlana?" Before he's quite ready the words leave his mouth, to his mild regret.\n\nStalina's face stays closed. She looks at her tea, a twitch flicking across her otherwise controlled features.\n\n"I wouldn't say so, no. The past is a different time."\n\n"Different, but rosier than the present. I certainly won't miss the days of fighting over bills when this is all over."\n\n"Oh, Nikolai. This isn't fighting, this is just...my father used to call it war without war. And look where we've gotten this Republic, by fighting this hard. How far we've come. If this is how democracy works, I'll stick by it."\n\nStalina smiles, almost wolfish. "And I know you, you old fox - you like it here as much as I do. You'd die without the next bill to argue down or to push up."\n\nVosnesensky laughs back at her. "You truly do know me. Perhaps I have still underestimated you, hm, Stalina? Yes, perhaps there is health left in this place - even if this old fox dies, Komi will struggle to breathe.""

A gunman retches to the side of the acrid smokestack that pours from the gaping hole in the house's remains. Those with a little more composure hold the sobbing townsfolk and the screaming widow away from the scene. (If she wasn't a widow before, she is certainly a widow now.)\n\nOfficer Popov takes a whiff of his cigarette, hacking as his fingers tremble. He's waiting for someone, and that someone is late. Lateness is not a quality the Vosnesensky Brigade (Irregular) appreciates. As the distant screams recede, his acquaintance swims into view. Grabbing irritably at the dust on his lapels, Commander Koslov makes his way to the burning frontage. He kicks aside a brick, nods briskly, and the two are down to business.\n\n"There is little to discuss, Popov." The Commander glares into the distance, pointing southeast of the duo's position. "You shoot two men here, we kill a couple more. We'll do the same this time next week."\n\n"Not what I was talking about. We're hitting those fucking Bolshies in our own neighbourhoods, so what about the others?" Popov is venomous, his searing gaze directed towards all of Communism, or perhaps it is focused on Koslov. "We need to spread out. This does nothing for the health of the Republic."\n\nKoslov brushes his ragged beard. His men will gladly go where there is game to be had, but control is thin enough in this district as it is. Is it worth the expenditure? Will their paymasters in the Parliament be happy? He shrugs. It will, in the end, be him who decides, not some waistsuited corpse. Democracy is built on the ground in Komi, even when it is built bullet by bullet."

 NIK.152.t:0 "Opening of the 1963 Assembly"
 NIK.152.d:0 "The annual assembly of the democratic coalition for 1963 took place in Syktyvkar's one good hotel. Perhaps by virtue of its lack of competition, the hotel's quality left something to be desired. But it was indoor, it wasn't in ruins, and the staff mostly kept the attending guests fed with a steady stream of passable food and piping hot tea.\n\nDelegates from all of the coalition's parties could be seen. Chief among them were Voznesensky's colleagues in the social democrat party and Kosygin's social liberals, the twin pillar of the democratic coalition. Present less in a political quality, and more in their role as important bureaucrats and power brokers of the coalition were members of the democratic government, such as police officers, bureaucrats and paramilitary bosses. These institutions member tended to gather around Stalina and her increasingly influential PSD party. The rising star of the democratic coalition drew much attention and courtesy visits from both other democratic parties. If this situation bothered any of the other party chiefs, no clear evidence could be seen in their warm reception of the woman and her closest associates."

 NIK.153.d:0 "Stalina spoke first, unattached as she was to any political organization. Her message was previsible, yet not unwelcome in these times before the electoral madness visited Syktyvkar.\n\n"It is a great pleasure as always to speak to this honorable assembly. I will not bore the esteemed member of the ruling coalition with my life story once more, if only to underline again how this free republic took me in in these difficult times for Russia. This gift of freedom and peace, of a place where we can help one another to rebuild our fractured nation, this gift of democracy enduring and untarnished, this gift is one I ardently wish to protect. As this assembly proceeds with the election of a candidate for the presidential elections, I stress to all gathered today: debate the merits of each presidential hopeful. But once a candidate for our coalition is chosen, I implore you to follow them without hesitation. The unity of our coalition is one of our strongest weapons against the radicals that seek to bring our republic to an early end. The dogs of the communist party, the animals found in Komi's far right fringes.. They care not one whit for our institutions. The republic must treat this contempt with her own contempt, for democracy must defend itself at any cost.""

 NIK.154.t:0 "Kosygin's Speech"
 NIK.154.d:0 "The leader of the SMR, Kosygin was next. His own rhetoric was not warm and passionate like Stalina. Rather, the former economist made a clear, concise case, his words, stripped from needless extravagance. After the customary round of thanks to the assembly, and the congratulations given to Voznesensky and Stalina for their efforts in the coalition, Kosygin reached the heart of his speech.\n\n"The Germans have squandered the wealth of their nation in fuel and bombs for a terror bombing campaign that has accomplished very little. Now, the frequency of bombings dwindles by the day. Rumors coming from Moskowien detail the upcoming collapse of the Reich. My friends, once the German planes are gone we shall be free to rebuild. We've kept hope all these years. Our childrens were taught as best as possible. Our homes were cleaned of debris where possible. Now that the terror bombing campaign is ending, the reconstruction of Russia can begin. New factories, new schools, new courthouses, new churches. The republic's citizens are strong and hardworking. A new republic is within reach." Kosygin paused. "It is my belief that this republic can re-unite Russia. Chosen as candidate for our esteemed coalition, and elected president of the Republic, I vow to dedicate all my energy to a new Russian nation able to house generations upon generations. Our cause is just, and it shall take us to the Pacific sea in the east... And to Moscow and St. Petersburg in the west. Thank you.""

 NIK.155.d:0 "After Kosygin's speech came President Voznesensky's turn. The president was a popular man in the assembly as ever, even if his star had dimmed somewhat as new politicians such as Kosygin and Stalina had risen. His energetic and driven way of approaching any topic had helped him lead his nation throughout a range of issues, and his particular way of speaking had its usual effect on the assembly of making everyone in the audience captivated.\n\n"Honorable members of the assembly, thank you for your presence. Thank you a million times for your support, for it was by your help that I could become president, and it was through your continued support that our coalition government has safeguarded Komi's citizens these past few years. I call once again upon your support for my nomination as presidential candidate. The republic stands at a crossroad, as shadowy figures emerge to the forefront of Komi's politics. Several sets of long planned intrigues are reaching their conclusion, and their impact on the Republic promises to be an unmitigated disaster. I request a new mandate to continue the struggle against the snakes that wish to usurp our institutions. Stalina was right in denouncing the group of rabble rousers that spread their poison into the veins of our parliamentary system. The time to strike is almost upon us; in a new mandate I would bring down the might of the legal system upon those who scheme the nation's destruction. Our institutions can, and must, be reinforced so that no matter the amount of muck thrown by our opponents into its working, our republic will live on to bring our people to a bright future.""

Komi must see greater liberalization in its economy in order to bring about a truly equal society. I call upon the National Assembly to stand for democracy and reform, so that our Republic may be the shining beacon to all of Russia's peoples."\n\nKosygin's speech fit such a prominent and experienced politician. However, Kosygin's critics asked how exactly his reforms would bring equality to the common man, and if Kosygin's speech was too optimistic and betrayed his tendency to focus too much upon urbanites and intellectualism. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Kosygin was the right choice for Komi."

A maddened sense of radicalism? Or, was it something about Bukharina personally that elevated her above the other candidates? Either way, Bukharina now stood before the new, much more left-leaning National Assembly, not as a Deputy, or as a mere Communist Party operative, but as President of the Republic. In her inaugural speech, facing packed observer boxes and a nervous Assembly, the passionate Communist laid out her plants for the Republic.\n\n"Friends, comrades, peoples of the Republic. I stand before all of you today with the utmost pride. Through our victory, the workers of the Republic have decried injustice, and carried out a Revolution by ballot - a Revolution not unlike that which liberated Russia decades ago. However, we must not be satisfied by our current victories. There is much to do, and much to strive for: a democracy that serves the people foremost, an economy which no longer places the needs of the bourgeoisie above those of the worker, and a vision for a future in which all peoples may truly be called equal! I call upon the peoples of the Republic, upon the workers in our factories, upon the peasants in our fields, upon the illustrious members of the National Assembly, to recognize that the dawn is only just beginning."\n\nBukharina's speech, as the most openly radical ever delivered by a President of the Republic, immediately drew cheers from the KPK's base - but her critics have decried her "extremist tendencies", "lack of true belief in democracy", and "reckless progressivism".

However, we must not forget what we have been - and what we must not leave behind. We must not forget the tenets of compassion, of faith, of love for our Motherland. In addition, we should not strive to fall to the enemies of our Republic and people - the threats of Communism, of German influence, and of the Russophobia that agents of foreign nations seek to subvert our great Republic with. We must not adhere blindly to a system that has allowed for these threats to rise - in fact, it is our duty to fight against these menaces where they arise! I call upon the proud Russians of the Republic, and for our illustrious National Assembly to stand for the best that we can be, for the best elements of our culture and nation, and against the enemies that face us."\n\nShafarevich's speech fit such a suave and skilled politician - however, left-wing critics of Shafarevich's election have pointed to the accusations of anti-Semitism and veiled hatred within his words, along with his continued connections to right-wing extremist groups.

This has started to discourage many other voters, and some of our polling places are even closing down!\n\nIt is not known if it was communist or fascist paramilitaries that carried out the attacks, and it very well could be both of them. If their goal was to scare voters, it is definitely working. Although, this does not mean they are only scaring away our voters.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not bode well for our election process, and we may see much less voting than we expected.

This has hurt the legitimacy of our elections, as it appears we are deliberately trying to secure our power.

Now, these militias have begun causing large amounts of violence, and conflicts with paramilitaries and police have begun to spiral out of control.\n\nThe rightists are also declaring the election as rigged, even though the election is not yet over. This has hurt the legitimacy of our elections, as it appears we are deliberately trying to keep the rightists out of power. Supporters of the right-winger parties are even calling for the resignation of our government.\n\nOur police are still trying to keep the violence confined to only limited areas, but it appears the paramilitaries will only continue to gain strength until the elections are over and the government secures power."

More specifically, Ponomaryov considered the two largest factions he could approach in his search to stabilize his rule: one was the followers of Svetlana Bukharina, the daughter of the former Soviet leader, that seemed to be asserting her position as an actor independent of Suslov. Another faction he could ally with was the supporters of Zhdanov; he seemed to be aiming for a socialist alternative, and had a significant following. He could, of course, stay far from both and trust in Suslov - but allying either one could give him the influence he needed.

"I am well aware of the role you played in Voznesensky's democratic government some time ago, and I am sure you gathered ... important lessons from that, as well as made some friendships with your former 'allies'. For the good of the republic, could you perhaps contact them, and maybe make some deals or remind them of earlier favours you had done for them?

Zhdanov nodded, his trademark grin never leaving his face - it wasn't going to help him over the phone, but it helped put him in the right frame of mind.\n\n"It's been such a pleasure talking with you. Thank you, thank you again, and I hope you have a wonderful evening." As Zhdanov put down the phone, his grin flickered as if changing telescope lenses - from one frame to another entirely, while somehow the essence of the whole remained. He turned to Boris Nikolayevich Ponyamorov, standing besides him in a mirror of false affability. "It's done, comrade Ponyamorov."\n\n"As ever, I am thankful for your honesty and your dedication to serving the Republic's aims." The aims of Ponyamorov, they both meant without ever quite saying it. "Comrade Zhdanov, for such a gracious offer on my behalf I would like to offer something in return."\n\n"Oh, I could not possibly - we are both public servants here."\n\nPonyamorov leaned closer, and Zhdanov could smell the cigarette breath on his face.

Whether it is a personal rivalry, their alienation by the coup that betrayed the democratic ideals they stood up for, or simply their hatred of the Left, very few have voiced their endorsement of Ponomaryov and Suslov. Therefore, this effort has been considered a failure by the upper echelons of the clique in power.\n\nAs if this failure is not enough, more problems have appeared. These military and police commanders, who appear to still fiercely maintain their loyalty to the Center, have begun completely disobeying the orders they are given by the governing committee. Some refuse to fight insurgents and keep their units far from conflict, while some democrats in the police have ignored commands to arrest or execute specific political opponents.

If you think about it, they do most of the actual, practical work, and are the ones who manage and run much of the smaller parts of the country, like gears in a large machine. However, deep down, they are all workers. Workers who must be awarded by the socialist system that works for their benefit. Thus, we need to show them how beneficial the new state can be. If we make them promises of increased pay, better work conditions, and everything else we stride for, then surely they will show their support for our side, and stabilizing our control will be much easier."\n\nInitially, many of Ponomaryov's allies were skeptical about the idea, as in their minds the bureaucracy was a remnant of the bourgeoisie that had to go away with it. However, it was an intriguing option to secure their rule. With some more convincing, the project was given the green light."

With most organizations and institutions throughout Komi under the influence of the government, we can use them to further our goals and expand our influence. Additionally, we have secured the support of another fraction of the population by delivering on our original promises to help the working people of the country. While it may have hurt the situation of the government, which will have to increase the payments and give some bonuses to the bureaucrats, in the end, it will be beneficial."

Initially, the results of the talks with presidents and chairmen of institutions of the Republic seemed promising, and as long as we gave some significant concessions, we could possibly secure their loyalty. However, small issues began to appear, and it seems that in the end, the vast majority of the bureaucracy is opposed to our policies, and even if we give them better work conditions, they refuse to support us. It seems that this is a lost cause, and there is no reason to continue with the agenda."
 NIK.187.a:0 "We should never have compromised!"

 NIK.188.t:0 "Mistrust Abounds"

Officials of the communist party have been conducting negotiations with leading members of the bureaucracy day and night for the last few days. Finding a deal that satisfies both sides has been incredibly difficult, and things were only further complicated yesterday, when the bureaucrats simply walked out of the negotiations, and refuse to cooperate with the authorities.\n\nNow, chaos and confusion dominates Syktyvkar and all levels of government in the country, as no one is quite sure what to do. We are desperately trying to salvage the situation as best as we can, but any success is unlikely. At the same time, many high-profile office-holders have resigned from their positions in reaction to these recent developments, and others are simply ignoring our authority. Let's hope this situation will be resolved as quickly as possible."

It was not just one large caravan, but many different ones, each coming from elsewhere. Some were coming from the north, some from the south, and some from Moskowien. Initially, they met the loyal garrisons of the Left, situated in the periphery of Syktyvkar to guard it from any possible incursions or threats. Of course, being in the middle of a coup, they were denied access. But some have resorted to more extreme means.\n\nWith only the key points around the city guarded, there have been "holes" in the security of the lockdown, and the refugees have used this to their advantage. Sneaking under forest cover or jumping over fences and barriers, many have entered the capital, desperately seeking to find shelter. The military does not seem to have this under control. What will our course of action be?"
 NIK.189.a:0 "Lock them in!"
 NIK.189.b:0 "Let them out!"

 NIK.190.t:0 "The Trojan Horse"
 NIK.190.d:0 "Perhaps our lack of action regarding the latest refugees to ask for shelter in Syktyvkar has been a mistake. Several reports from the city outskirts have shown that, in the end, these were not innocent civilians. Apparently, many of them are affiliated with Centrist and Rightist paramilitaries and insurgency groups, and have begun to aid them in the effort to overthrow the recently established socialist government.\n\nWe had believed that our forces had managed to secure the capital, by defeating the vast majority of the enemy troops in battle or disarming them. However, some holdouts continue their operations, and these refugees have immediately moved to help them in their mission. This has evolved into a major crisis, as we are currently in risk of completely losing control to the resurging militias. The socialist government is considering the options it has right now."
 NIK.190.a:0 "We shouldn't have been so merciful."

 NIK.191.t:0 "Intensifying the Crackdowns"
 NIK.191.d:0 "One could sense the tension in the air as General Secretary Ponomaryov appeared to deliver a speech to the army barracks near Syktyvkar, as he had gathered some of the most prominent officers and paramilitary commanders. Of course, not one of them was loyal to the Center or the Right.\n\nThe speech, ignoring the socialist rhetoric and vague promises for progress and reform made, focused on one thing: all loyal units, regular and irregular, would be united under one command, and create the Red Army of the Komi Republic. Closely modelled after all such formations in the history of communist nations, its purpose would be to defend the Republic from any threats that appear, internal or external. At the end of his speech, Ponomaryov received thundering applause, and was cheered by all his allies.\n\nHowever, despite the idealistic remarks made by the General Secretary, the Red Army's goal right now is one, and it is simple: restore order to this chaotic state and ensure the proper establishment of the new regime. The question now is who to focus on eliminating first from the two major movements operating in Komi: the democratic Center, or the Passionariyy right?"
 NIK.191.a:0 "Target the right!"
 NIK.191.b:0 "Target the center!"

 NIK.192.t:0 "The Hunt for Serov"
 NIK.192.d:0 "Ever since he was first involved in politics, Ivan Serov has proven to be one of the most insane ideologues in the Komi Republic. Despite originally claiming to support Suslov, his ideas of "Ordosocialism" have convinced us that he is nothing more than a Nazi in disguise, and him becoming Gumilyov' hawk has only confitmed that. Now that we are in power, we must do everything we can to hunt him down and bring an end to his movement.\n\nThankfully, during the battles for the control of Syktyvkar, we have managed to capture many of his men who fought us as part of the small militia force they comprise. Of course, most will be fiercely loyal to Serov, but we can still try to extract key information from them, namely where their leader is hiding. Through promises of gifts and reduced sentences, our police will eventually break someone, and gain what hints it needs to begin the hunt to take down Serov.\n\nOf course, the information we will be provided by his men may not be entirely reliable, and so some alternatives have been suggested. We have several other possible sources, that although less reliable, could be honest and lead us to the traitor's hideout. Who do we trust?"
 NIK.192.a:0 "Ask the deserters."
 NIK.192.b:0 "Go it alone."

 NIK.193.t:0 "Lies and Deception"
 NIK.193.d:0 ""Lies, lies, and only lies!" That was all the chief of police of the entire Republic had to say regarding Serov's men. Going into this, we expected to get at least some valuable information regarding the group's leader, yet what happened is the exact opposite.\n\nEvery clue we received from the captured Ordosocialist troops has been blatantly false. Not a single one has given us any actual help in determining Serov's whereabouts, each one feeding us with false and contradictory locations and statements that our police has worked hard to debunk, one by one. And now, it seems we have made zero progress in taking down the pseudo-Nazis. The leading members of the party have even started debating whether it is even worth to pursue this fringe group, as what power could it really exert? Now, we have been asked to make the final decision on whether we want to continue using our unclear sources, or end this investigation entirely."
 NIK.193.a:0 "This is a waste of time."
 NIK.193.b:0 "We can take another lead."

 NIK.194.t:0 "Setting the Trap"
 NIK.194.d:0 "The chief of police burst into Ponomaryov's office, holding a stack of paper and dropping it on the table in front of him. In the chief's face, excitement and joy could be seen, as if he had figured out something. Quickly, he began to explain his master plan for capturing Serov.\n\n"Comrade, I have found the solution to all our problems. Instead of hunting down Serov, hoping we eventually catch this mysterious man, we must lure him in. He will always find a way to escape if we merely chase him, but if we get him in the perfect position, we could strike and have the upper hand." The chief paused for a second, clearly to see what Ponomaryov's reaction would be. Then, he continued.\n\n"I have planned it all out. The story to lure Serov in will be a meeting of Ordosocialists, to discuss their survival and their operations against our government. However, it will all be a cover. The meeting will be held in this warehouse to the south of Syktyvkar", he said pointing at a map. "In the building, a special team of agents will be hiding, and once Serov meets his alleged allies, we will strike and take him down easily. So what do you think, Comrade General Secretary?"\n\nPonomaryov gave his reply. "If my comrades in the Party approve it as well, then it has the green light.""
 NIK.194.a:0 "Time for action."

 NIK.195.t:0 "Serov Reveals Himself!"
 NIK.195.d:0 "Serov quietly approached the door of the warehouse, careful not to make noise. He knocked on the door five times, as he had been told to do by his allies organizing the meeting, and the door opened. In front of him was not a face he recognized, but he imagined it was one of the men in his paramilitaries or the lesser known ideologues in his faction.\n\nThe man quickly gave an explanation as to who he was, and what the meeting was for. Serov walked in, and saw the table, around which about two dozen people were walking and discussing. He greeted everyone, and told them to sit down for the meeting.\n\nIn a dark corner, someone talked on a radio. "Target has entered the building. Over." The squad prepared to make their move, and kill Serov once and for all."
 NIK.195.a:0 "Kill him."

 NIK.196.t:0 "The Counter-Strike"
 NIK.196.d:0 "Serov cautiously approached the warehouse, and to his ignorance, several agents loyal to the socialist republic were closely watching him. Every step he took seemed to be calculated in his mind, and nothing was random. When he reached the door to the building, he knocked on it five times, just as his followers had informed him earlier. He entered, but was greeted not by faces of his allies and soldiers, but by gunfire. As he ducked for cover, Serov yelled something that no one could hear amidst the loud sounds of the weapons firing. But soon, seemingly out of nowhere, over a dozen of his men appeared, and went on the counter-offensive.\n\nQuickly, Serov's men began to encircle the building. Some of those pretending to be his allies tried to flee before being captured and suffering the payback for betraying him. Many stayed, protected by the government squad, but even though the trap was specifically designed to succeed, the tide turned in Serov's favor. By the time the sun had set, the gunfire had ended, and no loyal Suslovite remained in the building. Some had even been taken as prisoners, and no one could imagine what the Ordosocialists would do to squeeze information out of them. The trap, originally thought an ingenious plan, had ended in complete humiliation for the government."
 NIK.196.a:0 "We will have to try something else."

 NIK.197.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.197.d:0 "Within seconds, the squad ran out of the basement they were in, and stormed the meeting. Everyone ducked for cover, as bullets grazed past them and wreaked havoc. One man, Serov himself, once thought a mastermind by some, sat there in confusion. He had fallen for one of their simplest tricks.\n\nThe squad spread across the warehouse, and two of the men blocked each entrance and exit. Serov, having no other choice, ran behind a large wooden box and hid from the shooters. He stayed calm for one second, but immediately the sound of gunshots tearing through the wood made him panic. One of the bullets barely missed him, instead flying into the wall behind him. There were now few things for him left to do. He thought of ways to escape, but it seemed there weren't any.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted when a bullet went through his back, fatally injuring him. He dropped down, and his body was soon found by the police squad. Finally, Serov was dead, and with him, so was his absurd Ordosocialist movement."
 NIK.197.a:0 "The traitor is finally dead."

 NIK.198.t:0 "The Perfect Source"
 NIK.198.d:0 "It appears that we have found the best lead we have on Ivan Serov, and that is his men. The prisoners of war captured with our clashes with the Ordosocialists have proven to be an excellent source of information. We obviously expected them to be knowledgeable on Serov and his remaining men, but were surprised by how easily they gave up information. Perhaps they were not as loyal as we originally thought.\n\nWe have already received a detail on Serov's residence that is more or less accurate. He lives near the suburbs of the capital, relatively isolated yet close to the action. Additionally, we have been informed of the location and short-term plans and goals of what Ordosocialist troops and paramilitaries remain active. With such valuable intel, we could possibly make our hit and end this absurd ideology."
 NIK.198.a:0 "Thank goodness for this information."

 NIK.199.t:0 "Residential Matters"
 NIK.199.d:0 "The sky was completely dark when the men entered the house. The door was easy to break through, and there was little to stop them from breaking in. However, all eight men of the squad knew this could well be one of the most dangerous missions they would ever participate in. They entered the only floor in the building and quickly spread around it.\n\nEach man took a different position, making sure to secure it. The threat awaiting them could be anything, from an actual armed person to a trap, and so everyone was careful. The first course of action was to ensure that there was no armed personnel in the building, and that was quite easy. All hiding spots were checked, and the house was declared clear.\n\nThen, the next step was to search everywhere it was possible, and find any and all evidence. With such a mysterious man, finding hints to lead him would not be an easy process. No matter what they thought, though, they did not have all the time in the world to search."
 NIK.199.a:0 "Search for evidence."

 NIK.200.t:0 "The Plan of Attack"
 NIK.200.d:0 "The Democratic Coalition's leaders have arranged a very important meeting, or at least, what was supposed to be a very important meeting. The reason for the meeting was the... unstable situation in the Republic. Extremists, radicals, and political violence ran rampant. While the death toll was relatively low from all of this infighting, the Democratic Coalition fear things may escalate, leading to coups and the possible collapse of the Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears nobody can decide upon a plan of attack in regards to these fears. A number of representatives believe that the coalition should focus on the left and their dangerous revolutionary rhetoric. Others disagreed, citing the increasing violence from the right as the largest concern. A third camp within the coalition believes that all of this is unnecessary, and that we should simply focus on campaigning and winning the next election.\n\nThe debate eventually completely derailed into ad hominems and shouting matches, and it was clear to the leaders of the coalition that no progress was being made. By the end of the meeting, everyone was equally unhappy, as it was decided that the coalition will simply agree to disagree. The meeting was adjourned, the ad hominems ceased, and the politicians reluctantly returned to their homes."
 NIK.200.a:0 "The Left is the most immediate threat."
 NIK.200.b:0 "The Center must hold, no matter what."
 NIK.200.c:0 "The Right is too concerning to allow to exist."

 NIK.201.t:0 "The Interlude"
 NIK.201.d:0 "The two officers stare at the twisted corpse, his head curled to the side in a sick caricature of curiosity. What must once have been clothes hang to the side, limp and sodden with blood. Around his neck dangles the title, SOCIAL FASCISTS WILL NOT BE SPARED WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES. The stump of an arm - surely the amputation must have been as recent as it was violent - is tied off and secured with a little Party badge. One of Vosnesensky's men, perhaps?\n\nOfficer Timorovich nods mechanically to his Deputy. "Please note: case type 24-D, class B physical trauma. Prepare for physical examination back at the morgue. No further instructions." He ambles off for a smoke, and Deputy Sadckov begins to wrap the body in medical gauze.\n\nHow long have they done this, the two of them? A dance back and forth and back again across the Republic, picking up the shredded remains of life after life to dispose of in as tasteful a fashion as possible. The Political Crimes Division is nothing more than a sick joke, and the Officers of its hopeless war are jesters in the courts of the powerful. Crimes unseen. Crimes unseeable. Crimes that are discovered and hastily covered up, as with some idiot child that might spew up some inconvenient familial truth at the dinner table.\n\nSadckov's hands tremble as he covers the eyes. He is tired, so very, very tired. And yet the charade goes on.\n\nNot far from him, Timorovich wonders why there has only been one reported murder case this week. It is a precipitous drop from previous months. He rubs his stubble, and then it hits him, like a lead-iron socket in the belly."
 NIK.201.a:0 "They're prepping for election week. All of them."

 NIK.202.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.202.d:0 "Ivan Serov had not been sleeping well this night. For no apparent reason, he just could not stop waking up, again and again. But that was merely a mild annoyance in front of the recent events that had put his life and his ideology in danger: Suslov's puppets had taken power in a coup d'etat, and he knew they were already hunting him down. Serov walked out of his bedroom, and headed to the kitchen to eat or drink something.\n\nAs he sat in the kitchen, a sound could be heard. The door made a screeching sound as it opened, and whether it was his paranoia or not, that was a possible threat. He quickly ran down his home's hallway, and headed back to his bedroom, as loud footsteps and voices could be heard from behind. As he entered the room, he turned to lock the door, but realized that it was too late now. He opened the window to escape, and felt the wind blowing on his face for a mere second, before a gunshot was heard. Someone had shot him from behind, undoubtedly the dirty communists. Serov laid there, until his soul left his body.\n\nThe next day, a report would reach the office of General Secretary Ponomaryov, stating that, surprisingly enough, Serov had been caught in his house and killed by the appointed hit squad. Ponomaryov breathed a sigh of relief."
 NIK.202.a:0 "Thankfully, Serov is no more."

 NIK.203.t:0 "Nothing But Air"
 NIK.203.d:0 "The search in the alleged house of Ivan Serov continued all night, but as dawn came, it seemed as if no progress had been made. While his home did not appear to be a "clean" building, where any and all possible evidence was purposefully gone, there was still nothing of value for the police squad in charge of the investigation. A few notes seemed promising, but turned out to be nothing than vague ideas for yet another of his Ordosocialist manifestos and books. The bedroom and living room did not look as if someone had hastily left the house, but were tidy and in order. It was almost impossible to distinguish if this had been done on purpose, or if this was something normal.\n\nThe officers in charge of the mission were at a crossroads. What they had believed to be a treasure for information and leads on the Serov case had turned out to be completely useless. As such, many had suggested leaving the building and trying to follow one of the different clues the government had. But some still felt as if something was off, and with some more searching, the building could be useful after all."
 NIK.203.a:0 "We have other things to worry about."
 NIK.203.b:0 "We have other avenues we can use."

 NIK.204.t:0 "A Lead!"
 NIK.204.d:0 "The chief of police proudly looked at the note, carefully enclosed in a plastic bag as evidence. Its content was so simple, yet so helpful to his department: "Meet behind central Pazhga café, Thursday, 3:40 AM".\n\nIt had been found in a kitchen cupboard, likely hidden at first by everything else there. But one of his men had been thorough enough so as to search there, and there it was found. The chief knew two things: firstly, that man would be getting a promotion soon. Secondly, this was so big, he could very well be presenting his findings in front of the leaders of the party in the same day. Even he himself truly hoped that, after this entire hustle, Serov could finally be caught and face the consequences of his crimes."
 NIK.204.a:0 "Let's head to the meeting."

 NIK.205.t:0 "Ambushing the Ordosocialists"
 NIK.205.d:0 "Everything was in place for the perfect ambush. The days of hard work to track down one of the biggest political opponents in the socialist Komi Republic still at large had finally paid off. The note found in Serov's house had been enough for the government to follow on this lead, and prepare an attack on Serov at the scheduled meeting. After all, what did they have to lose from this?\n\nThe hit squad was composed of fifteen members, all coming from the army and experienced in battles, albeit usually ones between paramilitary units in the streets of Komi. Amidst the darkness of the night, they arrived in the small town of Pazhga in a dark black truck, going unnoticed by the local population there. In the dark road behind the city's largest café, which would certainly be empty at the time the meeting would be held, they prepared their positions. They hid behind walls and windows, or remained somewhere further away, ready to be called in by radio the instant the traitor made his appearance.\n\nAs the hour of the meeting came closer, the chief of squad, who had been obviously assigned responsible for organizing the ambush, had to make up his mind on what the optimal attack would be. He knew quite well that this could even be a trap for the Komi Red Army to derail their efforts. Thus, he had to inform the squad how hard to attack."
 NIK.205.a:0 "Ambush him with everything we have!"
 NIK.205.b:0 "This could very well be a trap..."

 NIK.206.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.206.d:0 "For once, good news have come out of the Serov investigation. And the news couldn't be better, as that investigation is officially closed.\n\nAs it turned out, the meeting in Pazhga was not a delicate trap, but an honest action by Serov, who did not know we were planning to make our strike there. When he arrived at the specified time, the squad hidden in the road was easily be able to hit. Serov was caught wih his guard down, only having very few men with him, and so we managed to kill them all, including the traitor, and leave the area with very limited casualties.\n\nWith Serov dead, the figurehead of the Ordosocialist movement is gone forever, and no one is likely to replace him. His followers turn to other groups or flee the country, and his paramilitaries scatter in the countryside, only to be hunted down by the Komi Red Army. The Serov case has been deemed an absolute success."
 NIK.206.a:0 "We no longer have to worry now."

 NIK.207.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.207.d:0 "The latest developments in the Serov case are not beneficial for the government in control of the nation. It appears that Serov was prepared to repel our ambush, and go on the counter-offensive.\n\nOur men initially seemed to be performing well, according to the reports of the surviving troops, but the traitor soon brought in his reinforcements. At around the same number as our own squad, they quickly dealt with the mild annoyance presented, and held back the enemy, while Serov managed to flee the area and move to an unknown location. While the Ordosocialist have still not been dealt with after this fiasco, at least the casualties of the "battle" were few for our own side."
 NIK.207.a:0 "That's something."

 NIK.208.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.208.d:0 "The ambush planned against Serov in Pazhga could not have gone worse. In all likelihood, the Ordosocialist leader had left the note on purpose, and as such was completely aware of what was coming for him. When our troops came out of their hiding spots, and tried to kill him, he fought back.\n\nFrom other dark corners and streets, Serov's paramilitaries emerged to protect him. Unprepared for such a coordinated defense by their enemy, that was supposed to be coming alone or with a small guard, our own squad was not able to cope with the problem. They fought bravely to maintain their positions and safely withdraw as Serov escaped once again. What's worse, perhaps, is the consequences of this skirmish. The reports claim that a rocket grenade launcher was used by the enemy forces against the squad, causing a massive explosion in the road. Unfortunately, our entire squad died from the blast, and so did 17 innocent civilians that were in the nearby building, which collapsed from the blast as well. Few know of what actually happened in Pazhga that night, as we have covered up the story, but Serov still remains free, roaming the country."
 NIK.208.a:0 "This has been a complete failure."

 NIK.209.t:0 "An Empty Room"

Every object had been examined and looked under, and every possible clue that could lead the police to something closely investigated. But, no matter how many men had worked hard throughout the day, absolutely zero progress had been made. Not a single clue had been found.\n\nIvan Serov was a mystery. Perhaps it was his time in the secret police, but he certainly knew how to hide, and he did it well. What worried Nikolai, though, was the reaction of his superiors. What would they think when they learned that he and his co-workers had found a dead end in one of the most important investigations in the history of the socialist regime, as short as it was?"

Much speculation on the future of this country has occurred, especially following the dissolution of the former regime. However, I have decided to broadcast this message to national radio, to tell you that a bright future is ahead for us."\n\n"Many of you have constructed an image of what a Republic ruled by Suslov's Socialists would be, but these premature conjectures are much different from what awaits it. I, as the General Secretary, will from now on be the leader of this country, dictating its policies and hearing the voices of the people, and from this position, I must inform you that the Suslovite plans will not be fulfilled. What the new government has to offer is the Socialist Alternative. Not a single person will have to worry about falling into poverty, or being chased down by the secret police for their political beliefs. The goal we have set to accomplish is that of a free socialist state, built on the principles of liberty and solidarity."\n\n"The Alternative will be not be built on exclusion of those who do not agree, but inclusion of all who can benefit. It is an undeniable truth that the writings of the first and the greatest proponents of socialism had the best intentions when creating and spreading their ideas. No matter how much leaders twisted them in the past, we are here to rebuild this Republic, for the good of its people."\n\n"It is for that reason that I ask you to respect the state that only cares for your own good and prosperity.

 NIK.211.d:0 "It seemed as if Zhdanov had decided not to end any last chance he had of working with the Center. Of course, what was once the leading coalition of the Komi Republic had been scattered by his seizure of power, and so had the Voznesentsi: some had fled Syktyvkar, either to leave the country and push their agenda from abroad, or to continue resisting from the countryside of Komi. However, some members of the former President's faction had still not left the capital, perhaps because they were willing to cooperate. And Zhdanov would capitalize on that opportunity.\n\nThe Center's left wing would be approached with an intriguing chance to remain in power, and that was to peacefully collaborate. Seeing as the new leader of the county had already made an extensive effort to support Voznesensky and his people to get into power, it wasn't that hard to believed that he would use the social democrats to consolidate his rule, which was by no means perfectly stable - even though this was a common occurrence for the governments of Komi.\n\nWhat Zhdanov and his allies understood, though, was that there was perhaps an even better way to solidify their control over the violent political stage, and that was by backstabbing. Having gained the trust of the Voznesentsi, it would be more than simple to make the planned meeting, in which talks with them over a national unity government would be held, a trap. They would be in a perfect position to be arrested, and so the social democratic faction of the Center would disappear in the blink of an eye. In the end, whether betrayal was the best choice was up to Zhdanov."

As was the plan by the Zhdanov government, we held the meeting with the followers of Nikolai Voznesensky, the aim being to integrate their group into our greater base of support. The plan has paid off, as after talks and negotiations with the social democrats, they have agreed.\n\nThe meeting was held in the National Assembly building, and had to last several days as some details were sorted out regarding the nature of the "unity government". In reality, as the faction in control of this nation, we were able to exert our influence and manage to pressure the Voznesentsi into accepting a deal that favors us. For all intents and purposes, we and the social democrats are one.\n\nAs for the fate of their leader himself, Voznesensky, he has fled the Republic. Stating it is no longer democratic but under a tyranny, he is currently at an unknown location, and perhaps he is plotting his return."

 NIK.213.t:0 "A Black Day"
 NIK.213.d:0 "Both sides of the meeting, the Zhdanovites and the Voznesentsi, could feel the tension in the room. The building they were in, what used to be the National Assembly of the Republic until it was forcefully dissolved, seemed massive in comparison with the few delegates that had arrived from the two factions to discuss.\n\nIn theory, this was a National Assembly meeting to "hold talks on the formation of a national unity government in face of the crisis the Republic was facing". In practice, it was nothing more than a meeting between a few representatives, as everyone else not part of the non-Suslov Socialists or the Social Democrats was obviously absent. Soon, though, even this meeting which seemed to show potential would devolve into chaos. Government troops stormed the building, trying to arrest all the supporters of Voznesensky. They replied in kind, using both firearms they carried with them and bringing in support from a nearby paramilitary unit.\n\nThe battle was fierce, but in the end, the small number of government troops seemed unable to cope with the unexpected arrival of reinforcements. Under cover from gunfire, the social democrats fled the building, racing to get out of the city before being caught. And it seems they have succeeded, as they disappeared, before the army reported that this group of a few dozen politicians had actually gotten across the border with the Vologda Neutral Zone, entering the neighboring warlord state.\n\nOf course, being neutral and with some democratic aspirations, Vologda has refused to hand over the "political refugees". We have given up on trying to get them under our custody again, as it now appears out of reach. All in all, this mission seems to have been a failure, and the only thing we can do now is cover up the affair from the public."

This has allowed us to design a plan that, should it be carefully executed, will allow us to capture Gumilyov and perhaps many of his remaining allies, ending the threat they present. It is of crucial importance to maintain the element of surprise and find the perfect moment to strike when their guard is down.

 NIK.228.d:0 "Our grand military is currently in need of more loyal bodies willing to shed blood for the Communist government. One of the most effective ways to gather more troops is to flood the national airwaves with our militarist propaganda in order to invoke loyalty in our subjects. Though much of our messages to the public are loud and threatening, it is necessary to instill courage and toughness into anyone willing to take up a rifle.\n\nUnfortunately, the broadcast of such propaganda may also deter citizens from their faith in the Communist system. Shall we continue with the broadcasting, risking the people's opinion of us?"
 NIK.228.a:0 "An excellent investment."
 NIK.228.b:0 "The wrong choice for the situation."

 NIK.229.t:0 "Seeding the Files"
 NIK.229.d:0 "Zhdanov mulled over the file from his desk. Apparently, the liberals planned to seize several files from the Party, although their plans have been discovered. Zhdanov wondered what he should do with this information. It would be trivial to plant some false information, and have them turn on each other. Especially if several of their leaders and politicians were to suddenly be revealed to have fascist sympathies, or were selling paramilitary supplies to the highest bidder behind their backs.\n\nBut was seeding the files worth the effort? If their interference were discovered, it could further unite the liberals, and cause some unnecessary hassle down the road. Planting the files seems low-risk, but you can never be too cautious."
 NIK.229.a:0 "Execute."
 NIK.229.b:0 "This isn't viable - abort."

 NIK.230.t:0 "Our Interference Discovered"
 NIK.230.d:0 "Days passed by, and, predictably, the files were seized. The files had been planted, but nothing seemed to come of it. None of the incriminated leaders were arrested, and the Republic seems to not suspect any collusion within its ranks. An informant discovered the planted files in the trash, which means the plan has failed.\n\nZhdanov's interference was discovered, but how? Was the information contradictory? Were the files out of character for those incriminated within them? Was there a leak from one of their own? Figuring out why this went wrong could prove crucial for the success of future plans. At least the liberals don't seem to be particularly bothered by it, which means that Zhdanov can investigate this small failure free from any distractions that could get in his way."
 NIK.230.a:0 "Oh well, better luck next time."

 NIK.231.t:0 "A Successful Operation"
 NIK.231.d:0 "Days passed, and, predictably, the files were seized. A few short days later, and several prominent liberal leaders were disappeared without Zhdanov's involvement. Judging from which leaders were disappeared, and the timeframe of the disappearances, it appears that the liberals took the bait. They fell for the false intel, and the operation was a major success. Zhdanov smiled to himself as he read the reports, a few rushed documents and an underpaid party official had allowed them to deal a nice blow to the liberals of Komi. Considering the success of the plan, Zhdanov thought that such tactics should be used more often, although the trick may not work as well a second time. None of that mattered right now, for today was a good day for Zhdanov."
 NIK.231.a:0 "The liberals are being so helpful to the cause."
 
 NIK.232.t:0 "A Pre-Empetive Purge"
 NIK.232.d:0 "There are many doubters within the Komi Communist Party.\n\nFew men pledge their whole faith in Andrei Zhdanov. Even his allies are unconvinced in regards to his main objectives. These party members may prove to be quite dangerous later on, obstructions to Komi's (and Zhdanov's) success. They may rat him out for being too much of an idealist, with no realism to back his cause.\n\nWhat hangs in the balance is the decision: should he eliminate these "allies" now, nipping the problem in the bud, or should he let them live and keep his support within the party?"
 NIK.232.a:0 "Hold off on this."
 NIK.232.b:0 "They're everywhere, as predicted."

 NIK.233.t:0 "For the Survival of the Republic"
 NIK.233.d:0 "Alexei Kosygin stares unenthusiastically at the meeting table. It is not the nice warm bed with a glass of warm water he was hoping for, especially after the chaos of the evening. The dossier on his desk covers an expected topic, blanketed on the cover like an obscene joke - RADICALISM IN KOMI. He flicks through the pages, his frown intensifying at the red names and cancellations on some of the pages - evidently taken from the Democratic Coalition's own census rolls.\n\nThere are quite a lot of cancellations.\n\nVoznesensky has the smile drip off his face, and he faces the assemblymen with little more than a ghost of a facial tic. He has at least the courage to be honest, even if what he is saying will make their jobs far harder than before.\n\n"Morozov spoke to me this evening, after the end of debate. He says some of his men have lost confidence in the Coalition. They're writing the letters as we speak, and after tomorrow we will lose about 30 men. These men are - were - our majority in the Parliament. We will move to formalize relations with the Communists and the Passionariyy Party in tomorrow's session."\n\n"There are still options. We are, after all, the incumbent - and our policies, while leaning on majority rule, are not entirely dependent on it. And after that-"\n\nHe stops, but the meaning in his silence is clear. It is unthinkable, the democrats of Komi plotting the arrests of their opposition. And yet - perhaps it is the necessary option.\n\nKosygin rides the tide of opinion. He clears his throat."
 NIK.233.a:0 "We should collaborate - they might be of use to us."
 NIK.233.b:0 "They are radicals, and we are incumbents. Ignore them."
 NIK.233.c:0 "False charges are easy. Restoring democracy is not."

 NIK.234.t:0 "Stalina's Speech"
 NIK.234.d:0 ""I speak to you from the Chamber in which all of our careers were made, and as I begin, I urge all of you to remember your first speeches here. All of us were once novices in politics, thrust into the Assembly by fate and desperate need. This was an unexpected Republic, and we were unexpected Republicans."\n\nStalina pauses, surveys the crowd. Old instincts kick in - her left flank's a little cold. Time to amp it up a little.\n\n"And who among us does not remember the old years? The arguments we used to have, before Vosenevsky brought us into Coalition and Opposition, about how this Republic would be. Who would stay in Parliament when a thousand dreams clashed at once? How would we solve the problems of the citizen when our castles in the sky waited to be built?"\n\nA little laughter, rueful almost. It's working. Stalina turns back to the main topic. Easy does it - like riding a horse.\n\n"My point is this: it was not because of the beauty of our dreams that we have kept our Republic, as the Union fractured and the old world died around us. It was not ideals that kept us fed, or clothed, or safe. Many assemblymen deny it even now - but it was the common belief we are sworn to uphold, the dream of a Congress for and of all, working not towards paradise, but upwards from the present."\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed.""

She drinks it in like a child on her first draught of vodka, spinning the words in her head. It's time to bring this party sky-high.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly-"\n\nShe barely hears the dull thud of the shot before a guard slams into her bulk, throwing her into the stage as the audience erupts into chaos. The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."
 NIK.235.a:0 "The bastard behind this will pay."

 NIK.236.t:0 "Calming the Storm"
 NIK.236.d:0 "Old Volkova listens to the chatter of the radio. It's a nice distraction from the constant thrumming hum of the wheat-thresher, and sometimes the stations even play good music. It's about as much as she can ask for these days, and it's not a bad life, all things considered.\n\nAt least this Stalina fellow who's yammering on the radio is a good orator. She tunes the rusty dial up a little, strains her ears:\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nShe nods unconsciously. She remembers the old Union, one where the flutter of the flags belied the dark hollows of its rule. Nowadays the only government functionaries who stop by are the ones who do census-taking, which is a breath of fresh air, really. Things have changed, and mostly for the better, haven't they?\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nVolkova finds herself clapping, for some strange reason, as the speech concludes in a roar of applause - and her thoughts stray to the old passport she still keeps in her closet, signed by Voznesensky himself in the old days.\n\nPerhaps she'll think about voting again, the next time elections come around - and she knows where the future, and her confidence, truly lies. "
 NIK.236.a:0 "A small victory for democracy."

 NIK.237.t:0 "A Bitter Silence"
 NIK.237.d:0 "Petro Grigorenko watches as the crowds gather around the Vosnesentsi-sponsored speaker. Factory workers and middle-managers, dressed in the slim-fit waistcoats and suited shirts that pass for Komi haute couture fashion - they seem like the kind of people to gravitate to his friend. In any case, Stalina asked for help in surveying popular reaction, and Grigorenko has never been one to refuse a friend.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\nThere are whispers here and there, like a rustling of the wind upon slowly dying branches, but otherwise there is nothing.\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nThere is emptiness on both ends of the radio this time. The crowd continues to whisper, but there is no hint of celebration, agreement or even vague positivity. It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave. Svetlana really isn't going to like what he has to say at the next meeting. Perhaps a little alcohol will help the message go smoother."
 NIK.237.a:0 "I'm sorry, Stalina. They just weren't feeling it."

 NIK.238.t:0 "Against the Unrest"
 NIK.238.d:0 "If we're to survive this avalanche of dissent that's flooded our streets, we need a plan. Currently, we control very little, and the dissidents control a great deal. With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."
 NIK.238.a:0 "Fortify everything we can and prepare combat teams for the ensuing riots!"

 NIK.239.t:0 "Direct Action"
 NIK.239.d:0 "The radicals and extremists hold a majority in our legislature, and threaten to destroy our democracy. Radical paramilitaries have been militarizing and arming themselves at unprecedented levels. The chances of a faction ousting our government are too great for us to remain passive. We must strike against the radicals, and remove their fangs.\n\nThe question is, which faction do we target? Both the left and the right pose a threat to the Republic, but our resources are stretched too thin to shut down both factions. We must choose carefully, and determine who is the true enemy of the Republic."
 NIK.239.a:0 "We must crack down on the left."
 NIK.239.b:0 "We must crack down on the right."

 NIK.240.t:0 "Effective Strikes Against the Left!"
 NIK.240.d:0 "Our strikes against the left have been a great success. Our forces have arrested several members of the Communist Party, and seized weapons from leftist paramilitaries. During our raids, several arms caches and safehouses were discovered and secured. The left seemed to have been unprepared for such an attack, and our forces have significantly limited their ability to perform a coup. The leftists and their revolutionary rhetoric no longer shall threaten our government, and our minority government is at least a little more secure."
 NIK.240.a:0 "Our democracy is now more secure."

 NIK.241.t:0 "Effective Strikes Against the Right!"

It appears our raids, despite their ineffectiveness, have nonetheless incensed several leftist politicians, and the left continue to arm and militarize. It appears our democracy's position has grown even less secure, despite our best efforts."

 NIK.244.t:0 "Into the Files"
 NIK.244.d:0 "In order to curb the influence of radicals within our Republic, we need information to act upon. The locations of arms caches, incriminating documents, and the positions of paramilitary commanders. In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"
 NIK.244.a:0 "Grab only what our spies can verify, so we can trust what we find."
 NIK.244.b:0 "Grab as much as you can, we can't afford to waste time."

 NIK.245.t:0 "A Perfect Find"
 NIK.245.d:0 "It seems we have stumbled across the perfect intel. Document after document, detailing the locations of weapons caches, paramilitary commanders, and safehouses. All of the information was recent enough to act upon, and barely any of the information had been encrypted. However, somewhat disturbing were the size of the weapons caches. If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time. Luckily, it seems the radicals weren't expecting a raid upon their headquarters, so we should have enough time to strike before they can act."
 NIK.245.a:0 "Finally, some good news!"

 NIK.246.t:0 "A Perfect Find"
 NIK.246.d:0 "It seems we have stumbled across some highly valuable intel. Several documents were discovered, detailing the locations of weapons caches, wanted paramilitary commanders, and safehouses throughout the city. The information appears to be up to date, and it seems the radicals didn't expect these documents to be discovered. If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time. Luckily, if we act smart, we can strike the majority of these locations before the radicals can relocate."
 NIK.246.a:0 "Finally, some good news!"

 NIK.247.t:0 "Too Much Information"
 NIK.247.d:0 "Sergei opened yet another drawer of yet another filing cabinet. Sergei hated patrolling the city, what with all of the violent paramilitaries roaming the streets, but this assignment was a truly special kind of hell. It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."
 NIK.247.a:0 "What a waste of time."

 NIK.248.t:0 "The Decisive Blow"
 NIK.248.d:0 "The Republican Army forces were mobilizing. The information gained from the radicals would be the decisive blow needed in order to stabilize Komi's democracy. The locations of arms caches and wanted paramilitary commanders would be stormed within just a few hours, hopefully before the enemy could mobilize. The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time. If this operation failed... then Komi's republic would likely not last much longer. It was now or never."
 NIK.248.a:0 "For democracy! For the Republic!"

 NIK.249.t:0 "Counter-Struck!"
 NIK.249.d:0 "The Republican Army forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. These forces were expecting to surprise the enemy, and were not expecting much resistance at the various arms caches they had located. If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."
 NIK.249.a:0 "Democracy's end draws near."

 NIK.250.t:0 "Successful Raids!"
 NIK.250.d:0 "The Republican forces spread out across Komi, searching for the wanted commanders and the arms caches the radicals had been stockpiling. If the intel was correct, a heavy blow should be dealt to the radicals, and the government's position would be made more secure.\n\nThe operation was a great success. Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."
 NIK.250.a:0 "Democracy stands strong!"

 NIK.251.t:0 "Their Forces Diverted!"
 NIK.251.d:0 "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."

 NIK.253.d:0 "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in "proletarian expropriations". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."
 NIK.253.a:0 "Keep an eye on the reds..."

 NIK.254.t:0 "Leftists Attack Police Station!"
 NIK.254.d:0 "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical 'lone wolves'."

 NIK.255.t:0 "Sabotage on the Roads!"
 NIK.255.d:0 "Driving in Syktyvkar, with its poorly kept roads and tendency towards street violence, has never been easy. Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious -as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."

Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."

 NIK.257.d:0 "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."

The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."

 NIK.259.d:0 "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."

Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state. These days, it seems as though the government is but a sheep surrounded by slavering wolves, with no way to escape or punish these vicious enemies."

As the republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergei Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come.

The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."

The police and the politicians are the greatest targets, but ordinary people can find themselves the victims of terror and madness without any notice. The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."

There are many in the city who feel as though the Republic's leaders have failed them, and in this political moment that number has steadily grown.\n\nProtests that once numbered in the hundreds now number in the thousands. A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system. Among the nervous ranks of the elite, one thought predominates: if this continues, the Republic's very future may be at risk."

All it takes to destroy even those institutions that seem immense and all-encompassing is a gradual loss of people's faith in them. Komi's institutions are new and brittle, and in the face of a crisis of legitimacy they are starting to shatter.\n\nThe public attitude towards authority has changed noticeably for the worse, much to the chagrin of Komi's police and elected officials. Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them. As the slow collapse of police authority in much of Syktyvkar confirms, the Republic is a long way off from earning back the public's trust."

There is the matter of our recent occupation, which has been neither gentle nor accepted in the eyes of the occupied, and there is also the matter of our perceived political weakness. Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause.

By this metric the crowd that has gathered around the Communist Party Headquarters of Syktyvkar have become more than a mere threat: they have become an organized danger to the Headquarters' occupants.\n\nYelling the names of Gumilyov and Shafarevich, the mob holds aloft posters declaring their unabashed love for Passionariyy and their equal hatred of the State. Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionariyy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation. In a sense, it is immaterial - the enraged mob reacts precisely the way one would expect an enraged mob to behave. Residents throw themselves against the walls, attempting to crawl up, and several are injured by barbed wire before the crowd succeeds in pushing a barricade aside.\n\nThe doors are locked, and the doors long since barricaded (standard Party policy), but one inventive protestor manages a parting shot.

Komi fears.\n\nTonight: hooded gazes, coming in packs, like hyenas stalking prey. Everyone sees the storm, the hail-like rain falling in the distance. They come anyway. Wordless is their engine - heart-stirrings from the crushing and cracking city. Komi is a machine, endless vistas of flesh, working like gears. They are spanners. Their time has come.\n\nPolice guards, eyes held like pistols, steady, unyielding, quietly lethal. Barriers, flesh and plywood, holding back the street. Whispers turn to talk, then to yells. Thuds echo - not thunder. Wood on flesh, unmistakable. Points, screams, then all at once, as an orchestra slamming into a new note, a sea breaking on undiscovered tides -\n\nAction.\n\nOne, two, three shots, and the crowd overwhelms the pistoleer. As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen.

There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - "no surveillance agents nearby" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt.

It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size.

The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties.

The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government.

Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or his rivals. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else?

 NIK.279.b:0 "If we don't plan this out and muster more resources, we are doomed to fail!"

 NIK.280.t:0 "Successful Media Blackout"
 NIK.280.d:0 ""While we were able to successfully raid the radio station, we sadly were unable to find the radio operator or any traces of where they might have gone. We restaffed the station with our own people, and it now plays classical music." Dimitri said. Bukharina smiled at him.\n\n"It is slightly disappointing that the operator got away, but I'm happy you and your men were able to end their slanderous broadcasts without issue. Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy. Maybe he'd relax tonight and listen to some music on the radio? There was a new station to listen to, after all."
 NIK.280.a:0 "The airwaves fall under our control."

 NIK.281.t:0 "A Complete Silence"
 NIK.281.d:0 ""During our raid of the radio station, we were able to capture someone. The information acquired from him let us launch secondary raids, allowing for the group coordinating the broadcasts to be captured. They are now under our custody." Dimitri said, proud. Bukharina smiled, very pleased.\n\n"Well done, comrade! I am very impressed with your efforts, and am happy to see that I have good, competent people in the army. Give your men my congratulations and thanks for their hard work." Bukharina shook Dimitri's hand. "I hope you can keep up the good work, comrade.""
 NIK.281.a:0 "Nothing feels better than success."
 
 NIK.282.t:0 "The Airwaves, Alive!"
 NIK.282.d:0 ""Our apologies for a delayed broadcast tonight, some of Bukharina's lot thought they'd actually try to shut us down!" The radio broadcaster said, before drinking some alcohol. "Thankfully, the legitimate army, in the Republican Guard, came and helped us out! They even managed to bring a tank and dealt heavy casualties to the communists."\n\n"You'd think the so-called government has better things to do than raid our little quaint radio station, eh?" The other broadcaster said, chuckling. "Maybe they're not as powerful as they seem, if they can't manage to knock us out? In any case, let's get to our program tonight: how Bukharina's government is doomed to fail!""
 NIK.282.a:0 "What a disaster."

 NIK.283.t:0 "Fascists Raid Supply Caches!"
 NIK.283.d:0 "Bukharina stared at the messenger, growing more and more angry. "You mean to tell me that not only have the fascist militias raided supply caches, but they raided the supply caches meant for wounded civilians?"\n\n"Y-yes Comrade." The messenger fidgeted, unsure of what to do as Bukharina scowled at him. She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else, or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"
 NIK.283.a:0 "The people shall be protected!"

 NIK.284.t:0 "Further Escalation?"
 NIK.284.d:0 "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."
 NIK.284.a:0 "Lock down the streets, we need internal security."
 NIK.284.b:0 "Go after the leaders."
 NIK.284.c:0 "We need to do both to secure the regime."

 NIK.285.t:0 "Kosygin Survives!"
 NIK.285.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Alexei Kosygin has survived our attempt to assassinate him! While we were able to begin the process of poisoning him, Kosygin quickly realized something was amiss and was able to seek medical attention, leaving him with no lasting effects. Kosygin has also managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with the method of assassination, in poison, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 NIK.285.a:0 "Maybe we should've been more direct?"

 NIK.286.t:0 "The Assassination of Alexei Kosygin"
 NIK.286.d:0 "It was only noon, but Kosygin already felt tired. Attempting to restore democratic rule in Komi was no easy feat, but it only seemed to grow more and more stressful. He gently rubbed his temples in an attempt to stave off his headache, to no avail. Did he have any meetings scheduled today? He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nKosygin greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Kosygin stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nKosygin all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes. A nice, long nap would be good, he thought, as he closed his eyes. He would never open them again."
 NIK.286.a:0 "A peaceful end."

 NIK.287.t:0 "Voznesensky Survives!"
 NIK.287.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Nikolai Voznesensky has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The soldiers sent to deal with Voznesensky were successful in their attempt to capture him, but he managed to escape when they were en route to the location where he was to be hanged, escaping into the streets. Voznesensky has managed to hide elsewhere, and is currently beyond our reach. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with Voznesensky's frankly astounding escape story, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 NIK.287.a:0 "How the hell did he escape that easily?"

 NIK.288.t:0 "The Assassination of Nikolai Voznesensky"
 NIK.288.d:0 "Voznesensky awoke to a gun pointed at his face. Fuck. The soldier holding the gun gestured for him to get up. He reluctantly did, seeing that he had no other option. The soldier escorted him outside, to a truck. Voznesensky noted that some of his guards laid on the ground, dead. Damn it. He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand. At least it would be quick."
 NIK.288.a:0 "A roundabout manner, but it worked."

 NIK.289.t:0 "Stalina Survives!"
 NIK.289.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Svetlana Stalina has survived our attempt to assassinate her! Her guards were able to intervene before she was taken away by our soldiers, and she is now in a hidden location. Somehow, Stalina has managed to obtain access to a radio station, and has broadcasted all across Komi about our assassination attempt. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the democrats decrying our underhanded methods, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism may become more desperate..."
 NIK.289.a:0 "We must prevail!"

 NIK.290.t:0 "The Death of Stalina"
 NIK.290.d:0 "Stalina stepped outside, only to be met by communist militiamen. They pointed her guns at her, not even allowing her a chance to say a word before they grabbed her and put her in the back of an army truck. Shit. This was very bad. Was there any way for her to get out of this? Where had her guards gone? Stalina tried to figure out something, anything, but to no avail. After an hour, the truck stopped.\n\nStalina was escorted outside, into what appeared to be a small patch of forest, fairly distant from any life. Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."
 NIK.290.a:0 "She died with dignity, at least."

 NIK.291.t:0 "Gumilyov Survives!"
 NIK.291.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Lev Gumilyov has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The bomb meant to ignite when his getaway car started ended up failing to activate, and he managed to escape the soldiers raiding his compound, later finding the bomb. We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assassination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the fascists decrying our underhanded methods as hypocritical as it may seem, will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 NIK.291.a:0 "Damn it!"
 
 NIK.292.t:0 "The Assassination of Lev Gumilyov"
 NIK.292.d:0 "Gumilyov awoke, disoriented. He felt one of his guards shake him yet again, shouting something about a raid. Wait, a raid? He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."
 NIK.292.a:0 "Only ash remained."

 NIK.293.t:0 "Expelling the Radicals"
 NIK.293.d:0 "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 NIK.293.a:0 "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 NIK.293.b:0 "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."

 NIK.294.t:0 "A Compromise Candidate"
 NIK.294.d:0 "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Vice President of the Republic with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Vice President, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 NIK.294.a:0 "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 NIK.294.b:0 "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 NIK.294.c:0 "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Kosygin."

 NIK.295.t:0 "Locking Down the Government"
 NIK.295.d:0 "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."
 NIK.295.a:0 "Take down the Reds."
 NIK.295.b:0 "Don't let a single fascist in."

 NIK.296.t:0 "Outside Assistance?"
 NIK.296.d:0 "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."
 NIK.296.a:0 "Komi needs every man it can get."
 NIK.296.b:0 "Our safety isn't for sale."

 NIK.297.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
 NIK.297.d:0 "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 NIK.297.a:0 "A military fiasco."

 NIK.298.t:0 "The Curfew"
 NIK.298.d:0 "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:00 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 NIK.298.a:0 "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 NIK.298.b:0 "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 NIK.298.c:0 "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."

 NIK.299.t:0 "Night Raids"
 NIK.299.d:0 "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."
 NIK.299.a:0 "Who would oppose such a reasonable lockdown?"
 
 NIK.300.t:0 "Directive 009"
 NIK.300.d:0 ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE Komi Republic:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that all legal parties represented in the Komi National Assembly are to be bound in a formal coalition with the Sovereign Democratic Party, effective immediately. This legally binding coalition will remain in place until otherwise directed.\n\nAny member of the Komi National Assembly who disputes this Presidential Directive will be expelled from their position. Replacements will be determined by the leader of the coalition. As the leading representatives of their respective parties, party leaders who reject the coalition or publicly undermine its authority will be expelled and prosecuted for treason.\n\nAll legally recognized parties which refuse to join the coalition will be considered threats to the stability of the Republic and consequently outlawed."\n\nThe Directive complete, Stalina leaned back from the typewriter. Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour. A decision had to be made, lest such violence draw any closer."
 NIK.300.a:0 "Kosygin and the SMR are the only trustworthy option."
 NIK.300.b:0 "Voznesensky and the DSNP are trouble, but they remain popular."
 
 NIK.301.t:0 "Directive 011"
 NIK.301.d:0 ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE Komi Republic:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that the Komi Police Force is to be placed under the direct command of the Armed Forces of the Republic. Chief of the General Staff, General Grigorenko, is appointed Acting Police Chief until the present situation has stabilized.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is henceforth to be considered an integral part of the Armed Forces of the Republic. All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."
 NIK.301.a:0 "Subordinate police chiefs to army officers, effective immediately."
 NIK.301.b:0 "Let them keep their ranks - they can figure out the rest themselves."
 
 NIK.302.t:0 "Police Reorganization Fails!"
 NIK.302.d:0 "Predictably, the Komi Police have proven as useless as ever. Their 'organic' reorganization has been completed, but not without days-long arguments, multiple resignations and more than a few arrests of problematic elements. The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement. It will be weeks before the police are able to quell the consequent unrest."
 NIK.302.a:0 "Our lives are on the line, you idiots!"

 NIK.303.t:0 "Police Reorganization Greatly Successful!"
 NIK.303.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that he and the police chiefs have successfully hashed out a blueprint for a smooth, rational reorganization of the Komi Police Force into an arm of the military. Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 NIK.303.a:0 "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 NIK.304.t:0 "A Successful Reorganization"
 NIK.304.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."
 NIK.304.a:0 "Trust in Stalina."

 NIK.305.t:0 "Directive 013"
 NIK.305.d:0 ""FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE Komi Republic:\n\nThe legal right to protest is hereby suspended for the duration of the present state of emergency.

Protesters will be arrested and prosecuted on charges of endangering public safety, or treason in cases that severely hinder the work of our security forces.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is authorized to use force to disperse protests, if such action is deemed necessary."\n\nThe Directive was short and to the point; Stalina was pleased with her work and smiled as she passed the final draft to her secretary. However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with. Perhaps the citizens of Komi, unsure of Stalina's leadership, could use an example to get them in line."
 NIK.305.a:0 "Break these subversives, commander!"
 NIK.305.b:0 "What difference could a single protest make?"

 NIK.307.t:0 "Mikhail Suslov Arrested!"
 NIK.307.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nMikhail Andreyevich Suslov, de-facto head of the communists in our Republic, has been successfully arrested. Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 NIK.307.a:0 "Freedom's torch burns away the shadows."

 NIK.308.t:0 "Failed Arrest!"
 NIK.308.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI regret to inform you that Suslov has evaded our security forces and is now on the run. The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."
 NIK.308.a:0 "It's not easy to catch a shadow."

 NIK.309.t:0 "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 NIK.309.d:0 "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Komi Republic. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""

 NIK.310.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

The rightist paramilitaries provided much tougher opposition than we expected. They might even have been expecting us. When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."

No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating. Got back up after a while, so we brought in a doctor who said he needed to be put in a straitjacket. That was too much bother, so we've just got him tied to a chair for now. Personally, I would ask that we deal with him as quickly as possible so he stops harassing the guards every time they walk past.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

We'll never find him if that's the case, not with so many troops and police tied up in urban areas.\n\nFor now, I've withdrawn the search parties and put them to work trying to find possible leads on Zhdanov's location.

How much further?"\n\nDaniil nodded and tried to point ahead with his right shoulder. "Just past the treeline. There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again. "You don't know what you're doing!" came the undignified shriek of a thoroughly terrified Andrei Zhdanov. "You're all out of your minds! The Republic NEEDS me - NEEDS the Party! Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. "Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit. Whatever. Andrei Zhdanov, you've been charged with blackmail, conspiracy to murder, um... treason..."\n\n"Abram, it's just us here. You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov."

Finding her was almost too much of a challenge for us to handle, truth be told. That woman has a veritable legion of sympathizers in her party and a much cleaner reputation than Suslov. There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that. Anyway, we found her in a civilian's apartment, probably some working-class devotee who's been sheltering her.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

The compass is no help, either - half the damn compasses in Headquarters barely work anymore, and this one has given up the ghost ahead of schedule.\n\n"Damn this stupid impromptu exercise," Sergeant Kuzmin snarls. Always a loyal follower, but never quite afraid to let his superiors know what he thinks. Leontiy doesn't reply, staring only at the mist. There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks. Those faint figures aren't trees - they must be the nearby hills. And if he can make out the hills, then - He scrabbles at his map, checking the faint contour lines. If he's lucky, he can get the shape of two landmarks down, like that one shaped a little like a loaf of bread, and the elongated ridge -\n\nLeontiy is a grown man of 37 years, and he's been in and out of barracks for his entire adult life. It takes all he has to keep himself from sobbing. He knows, for the first time in 8 hours, where he is going.

On all sides Ust-Sysolsk is embattled, and the armies grow ever closer in the black night, like a sheet, over the borders.\n\nIt grasps the hearts of senior citizens who watch the false-cheerfulness of the news and look into long-darkened closets, wondering if the old firearms are still working and if their aim is as sharp in their old age as it was at the first. So too the hearts of soldiers and generals, stifling their cheer and dulling the gleam of their boots. No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry. There is no one coming to save them, and what good is a government if it cannot look its people in the eye and tell them that things will, in due course, get better? The staffers, of course, are forbidden from even discussing such things. It scarcely matters. Just as ravens sense the coming of a storm, so too can the public sense the inexorable approach of a problem Komi can no longer deal with.\n\nIn a village to the south of Syktyvkar, children play the timeless games of all children everywhere: they run, aiming mock pistols and bows at each other, giggling as they hide behind walls and bushes.

However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests.

Others, however, have pointed out that doing so would hurt our already-fragile control over the government.\n\nBy not negotiating with the militias in control of the arsenal, we may not have access to the tear gas that could be instrumental in suppressing these protests, but if we avoid using the gas, even if it means more pain for us now, we may gain some legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

Taboritsky was quite tempted to put the final nail in the Republic's coffin.\n\nWhile both factions would have to be purged so that Taboritsky could prepare Russia for the return of its rightful Emperor, there could be only one first strike. Once Taboritsky chose who to strike, the other would most likely prepare for such an attack, making the Regent's position less certain.

Luckily, Taboritsky has two tools ready to conduct this purge.\n\nThe National Army may not be the best troops, but they are numerous and sufficiently obedient enough to be used for the Regent's plans. The National Army shall secure the civilian population, and patrol the former Republic's territory, locating and destroying dissidents and rebels.\n\nThe Shturmoviki, the Regent's finest men, and fanatic servants of the true Emperor. The Shturmoviki are of the highest-calibre, ready to do the Regent's bidding without question. The enemy could be Jews, Tatars, or Bolsheviks, the Shturmoviki will destroy them all the same. That is why the Shturmoviki's job will be to hunt down and destroy any scum too difficult to remove with the National Army alone.

In front of Taboritsky sat a pile of papers, all closing various offices and positions across the various branches of the government.\n\nFirst, those who operate the elections of the Republic. Democracy is a heretical idea used to dethrone the divine servants of God, and so they will be removed. Next were the courts, who are redundant when the Regent, and eventually the Emperor upon his glorious return, can do their job for them. The Regent's government will be better off without these positions, especially since many of these judges hold disgusting ideas that go against everything the Emperor stands for. The military police can entirely replace any civilian law enforcement, and will be less sympathetic to traitorous scum. Lots of redundant ministries and positions shall be removed, and the Regent will finally have something resembling an efficient state in his hands, ready for the Emperor's arrival.\n\nThose who prop up this bloated system must also be purged in order to heal this tumor-ridden state. Anyone whose loyalty can't be made certain shall be removed from office, and any who protest this dissent can be dealt with like the rest of Ust-Sysolsk's dissidents. They can be made an example in order to keep the rest in line. These empty seats will be replaced by loyal, obedient OVRI members, ready to facilitate the Emperor's restoration. With the drastic reduction in positions just recently implemented, their relatively small number will not become an issue.\n\nThis new state is not ideal, and it will never be ideal without the Emperor's presence and guidance, but it will prove sufficient for the Regent's grand plans."

 NIK.333.d:0 "Gumilyov sat in his office, reviewing the letter in his hands. It was addressed to Sergei Taboritsky, leader of the Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire, a minor right-wing faction. However, Taboritsky also had his elite stormtroopers, fanatics who would gladly die for their leader and his cause. Taboritsky was fanatic in his loyalty to Tsar Alexei II, who he believed escaped execution by the Bolsheviks. This posed a number of problems for Gumilyov. Firstly, Tsar Alexei II was almost certainly dead, so Taboritsky's mental health could be called into question. This meant he could be unreliable. Secondly, Gumilyov was not a monarchist, he doesn't care for the Tsars, and he honestly just doesn't like Taboritsky.\n\nIn his letter, Gumilyov worked around their differences, appealing to Taboritsky's desire to see Russia's borders expanded to their peak under the Empire. Some of these claims were natural: Retaking Moscow, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, among others. Gumilyov also made some more extravagant claims, including hinting at the possible annexation of Alaska. Gumilyov felt ridiculous proposing such a thing, but Taboritsky seemed like the kind of man who would make such extravagant claims.\n\nWas all of this really worth it? Taboritsky possessed some very elite paramilitaries, but were they necessary in order to overthrow the Republic? Taboritsky was also a strong orator, with a decent support base. Including the monarchists in Gumilyov's coup could lead to a power struggle if he failed to keep them in check. Gumilyov still held the letter in his hand, he could just tell his assistant to burn the thing, and just do without Taboritsky's monarchists. Alternatively, he could send this ridiculous letter to Taboritsky, and hope he accepted the offer."

He could use his newfound power as leader of the Republic to expand the conscription laws, although it could cause some unrest, and there was no guarantee of quality. Or, Gumilyov could, despite his dislike for the man, ask Sergey Taboritsky to lend his elite stormtroopers to the Eurasian National Army, who would form the core of his new military.\n\nThe obvious problem with this plan was that the stormtroopers were, above all else, loyal to Taboritsky. They may swear allegiance to some long-dead Tsar, but Taboritsky was their de facto leader. If he relied on Taboritsky's stormtroopers too much, Taboritsky could use his influence over them in order to take power.\n\nThis choice was effectively a question of quality vs quantity. Expanding conscription would give him quantity, although they would likely take longer to be trained, and likely wouldn't be as effective as the stormtroopers. The stormtroopers may be comparatively few in number, and possibly politically dissident, but their fanaticism made them a terrifyingly effective force."

She waves it aside, tosses the boy a dollar for his efforts and walks back into her house. The wind is chill tonight - perhaps a little movement of the blinds will be in order. As she enters the room the familiar clang of the ringing phone begins, but upon answering Bukharina hears nothing but dead air. After ten uncomfortable seconds the connection is cut. Confused and worried, she makes a note to dial up Medvedev and the rest to check if harassment against politicians is ongoing. Perhaps a reactionary Passionariyy cell? In any event, she has more pressing matters to deal with than a few agitators. She opens the envelope sealed with Party wax-seal, leafing through the brief dossier.

Maybe if things get bad he could even find himself in a decent position to turn his current 'promotion' into an actual promotion."\n\n"I don't see it happening. The Party seems pretty stable right now. I think Suslov will be screaming in his forgotten little corner of headquarters for a long time to come."\n\n"You're probably right.

 NIK.358.t:0 "The Manifesto of Ordosocialism"
 NIK.358.d:0 "Suslov leaned forward in his office chair, pushing his glasses forward as he pinched the bridge of his nose. The leaflet of papers on the table before him lay scrambled, the text upon them hastily scrawled as if written by a man desperate - or mad.\n\n"The Manifesto of Ordosocialism," so the first page read, in bright red lettering, neat and organized, a contrast to the rest of the work, a fact that Suslov found somewhat amusing, though he could not quite explain why. When Serov had presented his theories to him before, Suslov was optimistic. Though Serov was inarguably a brute, he was a loyal one, and wasn't ignorant of Marxism. Though Suslov didn't quite expect the second coming of Lenin, he hoped that the ex-NKVD chief would at least demonstrate some knowledge of socialism.\n\nInstead, he found horror. Suslov sighed and shuffled through the papers once again, the churning in his gut only intensifying. Nothing about the Manifesto was inherently wrong or reactionary, but Serov's wording, particularly in regard to what he referred to as "Hereditary Reactionaries," suggested something far more sinister than simple theory laid under the surface of the manifesto.\n\nSuslov pushed himself away from his desk, stood quickly, hands quivering, and called for a messenger."

 NIK.359.d:0 "Ivan Serov nervously rubbed the back of his neck, hands nearly coated with a thin sheen of sweat as he stared up at the towering silhouette of Mikhail Suslov. On the Shadow Master's desk lay a manifesto - Serov's manifesto. He swallowed hard, trying in vain to stand fearless against what had to be coming.\n\n"Comrade Serov," Suslov's voice cut through the silence like a knife, even though he spoke barely above a whisper. "This... theory of yours." He paused.\n\nSerov saw an opportunity - perhaps if he spoke fast enough, he could explain the revelations he had come to. "I -"\n\n"You." Suslov spoke sharply, losing all pretense of neutrality. Again, Serov felt a dagger in his stomach. "These musings of yours, Comrade Serov, they suggest you are dreadfully misinformed about several things. You have been called here not for punishment - not yet -, but so we may correct this error."\n\nIf it was anyone else before him, Serov would sharply challenge the notion that he wasn't being censured - but as he gazed into the cold steel of Suslov's eyes, words seemed to fail.\n\nFor what seemed like hours, Suslov tore apart Serov's beloved Manifesto, and in the end calmly banned him from spreading it under threat of party expulsion.\n\nAnother, weaker man would take this lying down, but Serov was not a weak man. He didn't sleep that night or the next, like a weak man would.\n\nInstead he wrote, feverishly, almost maniacally. In the end, it would be worth it. Suslov would see soon just how wrong he was."

 NIK.360.d:0 "The letter had arrived in the early hours of the morning, a time which Suslov would have much preferred to spend asleep with his wife; thus when the courier had nervously knocked on his door and quickly handed him the paper, Suslov had steeled himself to read the contents, and yet nothing could have prepared him for the horrors within.\n\nSerov had gone quite mad, that was the only explanation Suslov could believe. No traces of blank white paper remained on the letter he held, only the erratic ravings of a man scorned. If the Manifesto of Ordosocialism flirted with revisionism, this new monstrosity was practically wed to reaction. He read with horror at first as Serov detailed the valuable lessons to be learned from 'the thus-far superior ideology of the German,' and how the Communist Party would do well to 'adapt the tactics of victory,' which, as far as Serov seemed concerned, referred mostly to the extermination of 'Hereditary Reactionaries', state-sponsored corporations, and a promotion of German racial theory.\n\nSuslov nearly slammed the paper onto his desk, hand quivering, not with horror, but now with rage as visions of German tanks and camps flashed through his mind. A snarl snaked across his lips as he pushed himself to his feet. Serov had gone too far. This was not the questions of an uneducated socialist, but the deranged lunacy of a fascist.\n\nSuslov barely noticed his surroundings as he stormed through his office and punched a number into his telephone. A cancer had infected his party, he now knew, and he would see it excised at any cost."

Written down in the documentation as a residency for a local typography, the purpose of which is unknown even to their editors, the place served as a meeting hub for supporters and members of the Passionariyy and Gumilyov's circle, being an occasional headquarters and even a recruitment ground. The low profile and formal legality of their work allowed to keep their work going without disruptions, without any need to fear the eyes of overly suspicious people.\n\nThe arrival of figures in Soviet uniforms at the doorstep caught the personnel off guard. The leader, a balding, pudgy, middle-aged man, was not an unfamiliar face to many of them, but no one could place him with the names they knew, and his cold and severe look suggested that he knew exactly why he was here. The presence of the intruders would be instantly alarming, if that wasn't for the lack of weapons on their hands and a small detail of the torn off Communist badges on their clothes, an unacceptable violation for the people of their service. After a short, awkward moment of silence, the leader of the Soviet militants took the initiative:\n\n"Ivan Alexandrovich Serov, ex-NKVD and fierce patriot of the Motherland.

The true reason Suslov had called the meeting, and the actual object of his attention, was to discover the full extent of Serov's cancerous web within the party.\n\nThose who attended the meeting were loyal, and those that supported Serov would boycott it in protest, he knew. The news of Serov's expulsion had spread like wildfire, and his ears within the lower echelons of the party had given him a list of those who were less than pleased about that development. The most vocal of which had already been removed. What remained of Serov's powerbase would be too afraid to show their faces today, and Suslov would use that to formally purge them once and for all.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, twelve seats sat unfilled. More than he had expected, but not damning. Suslov quietly turned to his assistant and ordered their names purged from the roster. A curious situation had developed, however. One of Serov's supporters, out of stupidity or bravery, Suslov wasn't sure, had attended the meeting, all the while feigning innocence. An example had to be made, then.\n\n"There is one last matter we must turn our attention to, Comrades," Suslov pronounced as two large men approached the traitor from behind .

He looks like he has just seen the Devil in bed with his wife and with his wallet in hand.\n\nIt is fortunate that the General cannot escape this particular meeting through making foul faces - fortunate for the Republic, that is. A list of staffers and senior military advisors is thrown at his desk. An unsmiling Committee Deputy demands more names, training times, a full inventory of equipment. Gluchenkov growls that this is an unprecedented intrusion into Army business on the part of a few jumpstart apparatchiks. The Deputy, the iron showing in his face, points out that if the General does not hop to and give him names, the latter will soon have no business with the Army, or in Komi, or in the world of the living.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of such snarling, the General relents. He knows he's been dealt a losing hand. Still smouldering, he writes down a list of names with such volcanic force it nearly tears the paper - names of his closest staff, of his subordinates, even of privates and corporals far below his rank.\n\nThat night, hundreds of people enter the barracks of Gluchenkov's command headquarters at the XXth Battalion (Infantry). The next morning, about half that number leave. Some have simply vanished in the night, some have taken surprise leaves of absence, many have apparently resigned. And all around the Barracks posters, half torn or partially burnt, of a fist carrying a bundle of sticks are hastily thrown into fires, as if to exorcise a particularly unpleasant domestic dispute.\n\nIn the Parliament of Komi, a note appears on the desk of a Minister.

Surviving its troubled transition to democracy and the attacks from radicals of all sides, Syktyvkar provided itself a special spot in the Russian history.\n\nAs some political workers of the Republic developed sentimentality towards the city with which they went through the hardest challenges in their lives, it is time to admit, however, that in the light of our current strategy, Syktyvkar no longer fits as a centre of the democratic Russian advancement. It is too far from the core of communications in West Russia, and too close to hostile forces.\n\nIt has therefore been proposed to move the capital to Vyatka, the former residence of the short-lived rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor, in order to address these issues. However, many within the government hold that the capital should, despite all of the known problems, remain in Syktyvkar. This is both for reasons of administrative continuity as well as to honor its new history, and to further cement the unique identity of our nation.\n\nBoth options have merit.

The provisional capital of Syktyvkar, now purged out of bourgeois and fascist elements that overwhelmed the city in the later years, has served the Soviet government well and its capabilities came as a great aid in the more desperate times, but as our the outside situation plays more in our favor, we have an opportunity and move our capital to the central region of West Russia, thus allowing entrench ourselves in a more comfortable position."

All seems to be well so far, but an issue has cropped up- the issue of religion.\n\nThe Tatar people are Muslims, and our soldiers are overwhelmingly not. This has led to much friction- both in the region itself and at home. Three distinct wings have broken apart on the issue. The first pushes for an immediate focus on converting the Tatars to Christianity. After all, they claimed, it is our duty as honest Christians to bring non-believers back into the fold. This would be costly and take much time to complete, but could be worth it in the end. The second wing pushes for simply crushing Islam altogether- burning mosques, prosecuting imams, and destroying the religious presence in the area as a whole. This is a controversial idea, but would be easier than conversion- though the Tatars would certainly be unhappy. Finally, some have proposed simply leaving religion untouched- the simplest, easiest option. Of course, with much of the Right being religious themselves, this is a controversial position to take. In any case, we must act, and act swiftly."

Enclosed inside would be what would crack the Right in half. Shafarevich was splitting- forming his own group inside the Passionariyy.\n\nShafaverich and Gumilyov had never seen eye to eye on everything, of course, and perhaps this split was inevitable. The main force binding them together beforehand had been a mutual distrust of the Center and Left, after all. Without either of those posing a serious challenge, the cracks had widened into chasms, and it was no longer expedient- or really even tenable- to maintain the alliance. Across the right, the pieces fall, as Passionariyy members proclaim their loyalty to one side or the other.\n\nMost importantly, however, was which way Serov and Taboritsky would fall. Though neither commanded nearly as much influence as Shafaverich or Gumilyov, their support could be the push that would make or break one side's plan. These thoughts all rushed through Shafarevich's mind as he handed the letter to his secretary- now was the hour where Russia's future would be decided."

Shafaverich, ever the populist, is pushing for the vow to be for the people. Serov himself is pushing for the oath to be to the state. Finally, Gumilyov has used his influence to try and get the oath to not be to the people, nor the state, nor the Tsar, but rather Eurasia as a whole. Each of these groups are using this moment to try and gain influence- an annoying habit of theirs, but in such a tense political environment, it's only expected.

Both seemed to almost study the other, attempting to find what the ulterior motive of such a meeting must be. Finally, Taboritsky spoke.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke, Serov?" He questioned quietly, his gaze unmoving. Serov looked right back at him, unwavering. His voice sliced through the air like a sword- cold, swift, and deadly.\n\n"No, Sergey. This is no joke. I am entirely serious." Taboritsky cocked an eyebrow.\n\n"What do you mean? There's nothing in common between us. Ideologically, we-"\n\n"I know all about our ideological differences." Serov leaned in. "But we do have one thing in common. We're on the outside looking in. Those bastards Gumilyov and Shafarevich think that it's a two horse race. Why don't we work together, get rid of them, and then sort it out between us?"\n\nTaboritsky didn't expect the brutal honesty, but he couldn't say he disagreed.

Shafarevich continued. "What is it you wish to see me about?"\n\n"Igor, you know as well as I do that the fate of the party is soon at hand. Gumilyov, Taboritsky, you and I are all competing for leadership. However, the prospect of a Gumilyov or Taboritsky-led Passionariyy. . .worries me. Gumilyov is a lunatic, and Taboritsky- I cannot tell if Taboritsky is high half of the time."\n\n"My god, you really are quite blunt, are you?" Shafarevich chuckled. "And what about me, Serov? I know that we disagree on many points. What makes you so receptive to me, rather than the others?"\n\n"I don't particularly like you, Igor." Serov leaned forward.

His eyes flickered up and down before he began. "What are you doing in my office, Igor?"\n\n"Lev, I know we're not on the best of terms-" Gumilyov cocked an eyebrow. "But you're the best option we have."\n\n"I thought you split from my party for a reason, Igor." Lev stated. "Why would you come back to me now?"\n\n"Serov and Taboritsky are lunatics, Lev. They're insane. They'll drive the whole country off a cliff, and they'll kill us all while they're at it. You see that, right? We don't agree on much, but for the sake of our country, can we not come together, just this once?"\n\nLev looked him over again. Did he really need Shafarevich? He could win alone just as well as with Igor. However, the chance of Taboritsky or Serov winning, small as it may be, was simply too much of a risk to leave up to fate. Perhaps it wouldn't last too long after the conference, but it worked before. Perhaps it could work again."

First came Gumilyov, surrounded by guards, he and his representatives taking their seats in the center of the Assembly. Next came Shafarevich, his men surrounding him as dutifully as Gumilyov's. They took their place to the left of the Assembly.\n\nThere was a short delay before Serov, his men clad in Soviet uniform with the stars ripped off, stepped through the doors. They took their spot in between Gumilyov and Shafaverich, and the venom began to spit between the factions- verbal tussles, insults, angry whispers. Finally, Taboritsky and his men filed in, taking their seats on the right of the Assembly floor.\n\nThe stage was set for a political explosion of biblical proportions- the only thing to do now was to give the speeches, take cover, and wait for the pieces to fall."

 NIK.383.t:0 "The Vote"
 NIK.383.d:0 "It was here. Hours of yelling, of politicians stomping their feet, of passionate speeches and angry rebuttals. A fistfight had even broken out once or twice. After a long, arduous journey, the men and women of the National Assembly rose to cast their votes on who should lead Komi into the future.\n\nGumilyov didn't show it, but his heart pounded against his ribcage as the silence grew. A truck was waiting outside in the unlikely case he lost- and he did not expect to lose. If he won, the plans to dispose of Taboritsky and Serov were clear in his mind, to be executed almost immediately- before they could escape. Shafarevich was a different story, but he would get around to him soon enough.\n\nShafarevich hid his face behind his papers to hide his growing fear. Plans swirled through his head, mixing and mashing- an escape plan here, an execution plan there. Whichever one he would need to implement, he was certainly ready.\n\nSerov's ice cold face didn't betray a hint of nervousness. His mind had filed with plans- plans to leave, plans to stay. He would win, or he would leave, and he suspected the rest of the room felt the same way, as much as they tried to hide their emotions.\n\nTaboritsky drummed his fingers against the table. Could he do it? Could he win? If not, what then? He hadn't thought that part of this all the way through- his half-formed plan ending at leaving the city in a car as quickly as possible. Whatever he did after this vote, he knew it would decide his fate.\n\nAs the votes were counted, the tension increased. As it was about to burst, a man stepped up to the podium and began to read."

 NIK.384.d:0 "A stunned silence enveloped the National Assembly as the final result was read. Gumilyov rose from his seat, shocked. Shafarevich's eyes widened in astonishment. Serov's face broke for a moment, showing his absolutely confounded expression. For a moment, there was silence in the room.\n\nAnd then everything began to move.\n\nMen exploded from their seats, shouting unintelligibly about a rigged vote. Some began shaking down those around them, searching for the traitors to the party, to their leader, to the nation. Others made a beeline for the door- their hand was played and lost, and the only thing they could do was leave. Still others rushed towards Taboritsky's joyous men, stopped only by a line of policemen and guards separating the groups from each other. The noise echoed off the walls, only escalating into a cacophony of chaos.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Taboritsky's smile spread across his face. He had always known he was in the right. He knew he would win, no matter what the others thought. Once again, he was correct. Now, the rest of the Right would see what Sergey Taboritsky really was."
 NIK.384.a:0 "It can't be true!"

 NIK.385.t:0 "Serov Triumphant!"
 NIK.385.d:0 "Serov did not smile often. He prided himself on his calm, cold exterior. After all, "Friendly" and "NKVD officer" were not mixable traits. The last time he could remember himself smiling- genuinely smiling, not just the crocodile smile he gave to those he needed for his plans- was at his desk long ago, writing out his masterpiece. He could remember the ecstasy of the final tap of the typewriter, and he could remember the crushing blow of Suslov, rather than even taking a moment to truly think about his writings, casting it aside out of hand. If only old Mikhail could see him now!\n\nHe had worked hard in the last years. Going from the Left to the Right was nearly unheard of, and it took much time for them to trust him as one of their own. He was no fascist, not at all. At heart, he was still a socialist- just not one of those doddering fools or naive idealists who seemed to think that slapping the same red coat of paint on Russia would be enough to win. He knew better. Maybe Russia hadn't wanted to accept it then, but they were going to accept it now. He would make them.\n\nAnd so, as chaos swept the floor of the National Assembly, and men leapt from their seats in astonishment at what was thought to be impossible, Serov allowed himself a genuine smile."
 NIK.385.a:0 "How'd he pull it off?"

 NIK.386.t:0 "Shafarevich Triumphant!"
 NIK.386.d:0 "The Assembly had expected two outcomes to the meeting. The expected outcome was that Gumilyov would enter as head of state and emerge as head of state. After all, was he not the driving force of the Right? The underdog story was Igor Shafaverich- the compassionate conservative, as he styled himself. Shafarevich had been the young face of the Passionariyy, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of Komi. This was not a position he particularly wanted, and his split from Gumilyov's wing drew much attention. Most analysts agreed, however- Shafarevich had made his move too early. His bid for power would come up short, and then he'd surely be in for it.\n\nWhen the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was named the new head of state, the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many. As the men and women of the Assembly filed out, Shafarevich took a moment to savor his victory. Soon, he could really get to work."
 NIK.386.a:0 "An unexpected outcome."

 NIK.387.t:0 "Gumilyov Triumphant!"
 NIK.387.d:0 "It was always expected that Lev Gumilyov would win. It was the outcome most thought would occur- Lev Gumilyov would enter as head of state and exit as head of state. So when it actually happened, the most chaotic the Assembly got was a small murmur of affirmation and clapping from his own wing. What was much more interesting was the events immediately afterwards.\n\nSerov and Taboritsky both rose from their chairs and made their exits- Taboritsky nearly dashing to the exit, while Serov at least had the brains to keep his mask of calm up as he left. No doubt, Gumilyov thought as he watched them go, they were going to try and cause trouble. He sighed- just another thing to hang them for. His eyes flicked to Shafaverich, who had not left. What was he to do with him? It would take longer to get rid of a man as popular as Igor, but it would be done, eventually. Soon enough, Gumilyov would be alone at the top, and the Eurasianist dream could finally be realized.\n\nAs truck engines outside roared into the distance, Gumilyov's joyous demeanor finally returned, and his heart stopped beating so hard. He would never admit it to anyone, but he was a little worried there."
 NIK.387.a:0 "As expected."

 NIK.388.t:0 "The Anti-Establishment Coalition Triumphant!"
 NIK.388.d:0 ""What?"\n\nThere was a single word spoken when the results came in, and all eyes turned to it. Gumilyov had fled from his seat, and Shafaverich had done the same. Both men were the only two standing, facing down the Assembly, to the center. The rest of the Assembly was stunned into silence- not even able to voice their shock and disbelief.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke?" Gumilyov asked, the color draining from his face. The man at the center shook his head. Shafeverich and Gumilyov shared a look- terror, perhaps, or disbelief- and turned back to the man. It couldn't be true.\n\nAnd then, they began to leave.\n\nIt started as a trickle of shell-shocked representatives before the dam broke, a cacophony of footsteps desperate to get out of the way of the hell that was soon to come. Serov and Taboritsky watched the fleeing masses before their eyes locked onto each other. Gumilyov and Shafaverich were gone, thrown into the trashcan of history- the question now was whether Taboritsky or Serov would follow them. The little goodwill built between the two would soon fall to pieces, and then the final battle over Komi's future would begin."

Then they reach out to each other and shake hands. The Convergence is over, and the Impossible Duo has, against all odds, beaten back their opposition amongst the Rightists of Komi.\n\nThe effect is instantaneous: Gumilyov, upon hearing of his defeat, has the cheer crumble off his face, along with his confidence. His hands trembling, he points to the Coalition and snaps, "It was - it was the Romano-Germanics that did this! They have usurped the will of the People, putting impostors in my - our place!" As his own followers stare at this sudden lurch into idiocy, the spell is broken. Gumilyov finds himself the centre of a gradually widening circle, and as he is dragged out of the hall for disorderly conduct no one follows him, or bats an eye.\n\nTaboritsky, conversely, chuckles. He bows his head and he begins to laugh, in uproarious bursts that heave the breath from him, and when he is finished he wipes the tears from his eyes. His eyes shining, he points towards the ceiling in rapturous wonder and proclaims only this:\n\n"I have been wrong. All this time. Perhaps the King I seek shall not be found through me - perhaps I am not a worthy vessel. But as for YOU!" He points to the increasingly confused duo. "Promise me you will follow the will of the Skein. Promise me!" He falls silent, and his own entourage applaud politely, while the rest of the Passionariyy stare in mute horror.\n\nSerov glances at Shafarevich, and there is no warmth shared in the glance, only the cold taste of victory and the colder calculus running through the minds of both.

If Lev Gumilyov had any doubts about the outcome, he was doing a good job of hiding it. Igor was less assured. The rise of Taboritsky and Serov to become real contenders for the Convergence had left him thoroughly rattled, and he felt more anxious than he'd ever expected to. He drew some calm from his ally, however, and kept his composure. A few minutes later, it was finally time to announce the results of the vote.\n\n"The winners of the vote and leaders of the Passionariyy are Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich." The Assembly erupted into cheers, their supporters expressing the relief also washing over him. As Igor got out of his seat, he was pulled into a big hug by Gumilyov, the force of which betrayed that his ally, too, had carried doubts of their success. It didn't matter anymore. Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course. While no doubt weakened by their defeat here, both men had the potential to make a real nuisance of themselves. But that was a problem for another day. Today they would celebrate."

Their gambit proved successful, and the two now share leadership of the organization. With their common foes overcome, few expected the alliance to last very long, an expectation which has now proven accurate.\n\nOnly hours after the end of the Convergence, the two men have already renounced one another. Their respective supporters are already on the move, and life is once again brought to a terrified stop as a fierce power struggle plays out on its streets. While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee. Enigmatic tsarist or NKVD-turned-nationalist, whoever wins this most recent contest will be the master of Komi, whoever loses will be dead in a ditch.

Many assumed it would break inevitably - and that to bet on Ivan Serov would be the obvious choice. With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."

Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished.

Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. "I will protect the proletariat." "I will restore socialism." "I will keep the traditions of the past alive." Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them.

The Imperial decorations and luxurious refreshments would reinforce his message of Imperial Greatness. He gave the invited guests ample time to enjoy both and waited until a little over two hours into the party before judging that the time had come, and taking the stage.\n\n"My dear friends, fellow Russians. We have taken an important step towards unifying our great Tsardom. It is, however, but the first step of many. Since the loss of the Holy Tsar, Russia has fallen far. Our motherland lies broken and shattered - her people divided, fearful, and in need. That unrighteous betrayal, and our failure to prevent it, set us on this path to destruction, and now, the only path back is through righteousness. A righteous Tsar to lead a righteous people. A righteous people to march away from the humiliations of today and yesterday, away from the spectres of fear, want, and division, towards a future where the greatness of Russia is restored."\n\n"That Tsar lives! Alexei II survived the Bolshevik terror and waits, in hiding, for his throne to be restored. Only then will it be safe for him to return. Only then will righteousness rule the land once more. Until that time, strong leadership is needed to prepare Russia for his arrival. As Regent, I will provide that leadership. I will lead us on the path of righteousness and I welcome all of you to walk it with me. Together, we will restore Russia to greatness!

Private, secure, and away from prying eyes.\n\nShafarevich was the first to arrive, a polite grin on his face as he passed into the room like a peacock, strolling with an elegant yet leisurely gait. Gumilyov nearly rolled his eyes at the display, for there were no crowds at this hour for him to woo with his honeyed words and silver tongue. Greetings were exchanged, then patience.\n\nNext came Serov, entering slowly and intently as his eyes swept across the room, like a wolf eying the landscape... or its next meal. Ambition was something all of his guests had, but the former leftist had history they did not.\n\nFinally, the final guest slithered in silently, his eyes slits and his smile unnervingly fixed. A reaction Sergei Taboritsky commonly got from those he spoke with was befuddlement at best - terror at worst.\n\nAll of his guests would have a say in the paper resting between the four men to garner legitimacy for the new state, and all of his guests eyed his position of power eagerly.

 NIK.403.t:0 "The Matter of Economic Structure"
 NIK.403.d:0 "A crucial facet of any state is the structure of the economy, and our constitution needs to lay out how we will approach ours. The breadth of thought in our alliance means there are many competing ideas for how to address this. There is a general agreement that the government needs to be in control of several important sectors in the economy, but beyond that, there is little common ground to be found.\n\nA large faction contend that we must allow market forces to operate in non-strategic spheres of the economy. They say private enterprises will complement their state-run counterparts to provide greater welfare for all. The best way to achieve both would be to provision for private property rights in our constitution while also specifying that it can be overruled and under what conditions.\n\nThere are many, however, who believe we can only realize our plans under a total command economy. Everything in the republic belongs to the whole nation, and it is only right that the nation be empowered to mobilize every farmer, worker and clerk to achieve its aims. Private businesses will always, by their very nature, undermine this aim. The constitution should, according to this faction, define all property as belonging to the state.\n\nTaboritsky's faction advocates a third approach. They say that it is these modern economic theories and structures that got Russia to this sorry state. We must cast away these foreign theories and look back to the heyday of Russia. The traditional way of life is what will restore Russia to greatness, and that starts with the economy. The constitution must empower the state to take any measures necessary to return Russians to where they belong."

 NIK.404.d:0 "With power more secured, new options for the future of our state have come to the table as the constitution begins its drafting. One such debate has recently come into view of our leadership: the role of the central government in relation to various regions. Taboritsky, of course, proposes that regional administrations hold no power, and only the central government would rule with an iron fist. Shafarevich, instead, proposes a lighter alternative: Federalism, leaving some power in the hands of regional administrations while the central government still rules strongly. Lastly, Gumilyov fights strongly for self determination among the regions, instead forming a sort of confederacy. Tensions increase, but ultimately one side wins the day:"

 NIK.405.t:0 "Means to an End"
 NIK.405.d:0 "Shafarevich poured himself another drink. Gumilyov erased another line he didn't like. Taboritsky accidentally tore another clump of hair from his scalp. Each of the men sat in their own homes, dwelling on thoughts of the past and the future as they shamelessly tried to throw themselves into projects to distract from or alleviate these.\n\nShafarevich knew he had to both make some sacrifices and some compromises to get where he was, at the cusp of power. Yet, as he set the bottle down, he couldn't help but worry. He felt what he was doing was for the good of Russia, he swore to himself, and yet he felt himself drifting further from his principles as he climbed into the echelons of the party. But damn was it a long climb.\n\nGumilyov, as he always did, was polishing one of his rough theories, scribbling on an old sheet of paper at his desk. The time was coming when these would be fact, and he had worked hard to near that occasion. He didn't have the same way with words as his father, the poor bastard, but he was having an easy enough time getting an idea out. Shame they wouldn't stay on the page, as he scratched out each halfway decent sentence he wrote. Determination and, for lack of a better term, passion had brought him to this point, but as evidenced by his writer's block: would it bring him any further than this?\n\nTaboritsky, meanwhile, was on a roll. While passion had brought Gumilyov to the top and Shafarevich had planned his way there, Taboritsky rose in a frenzy. That was his constant state. He had to be planning, moving, seething. Thus, while the rest of those in household were asleep, he was tearing through maps ranging from 1600 all the way to 1962. Most of them were wrong, but he continued to look through them one after the other over and over in search of the true monarch of Russia. That was his goal, after all. To rebuild. To grow. Russia, like him, was a controlled frenzy."

It was the last one before a true leader of Komi, and later Russia at large, would be empowered. With most of the men in the room stubbornly decided on who they supported, some still stood in the middle. Thus, while others dozed in waiting for another speech to ignore or affirm their beliefs, some sat on the edge of their seats as they waited for someone to take the stage.

 NIK.407.d:0 "The first villager to see the Deputy sweeping the streets is a child of perhaps ten or eleven years - his steps echo down the cobblestone path well before he reaches the sweating, suit-clad man struggling with a broom. He stops for a while in whatever passes for stupefaction in the youth, makes a face and walks away. The Deputy calls after him, "Have a good day! The Government is here for you if you need anything!"\n\nThe next few villagers arrive all at once, in a station-wagon almost falling apart with rust and disuse. The Deputy calls out to them too, shouting, "Have a good day! The Government of Komi works only for you!" Muted laughter resounds from the car's cabin and a face reaches out from what must once have been a window. "Have a good day, Deputy! Must be a lonely day in the office, yes?"\n\nThe Deputy, beaming, turns to reply, but the station-wagon's low growl cuts him off before he can say anything. He looks into the massive cloud of smoke, still smiling, and carries on. So it continues through the morning, the sweeping of stray leaves and the urban garbage of Komi's 57th District into giant piles - and the disposal of these piles into burlap sacks. People stare curiously - once or twice visitors ask for signatures, something which the Deputy is only too happy to provide. Always he reminds the people he meets to vote and keep the Government accountable - something which they can also fulfill by writing to himself.\n\nAs noon towers over Komi the Deputy stumbles into his office, nearly tripping over the carpet. The smile disappears from his face. Glowering, he begins to laboriously type a transcript of his day's endeavors - starting with the number of people he has greeted, and the number of We Believe In The Komi Republic! badges he has given out.\n\nNearly breaking the typewriter with his hammy fingers, he writes:"

Few noticed any difference at first; Sergey Taboritsky was known for his authoritarianism and harsh dictates, after all. It was no secret that there were few lines which he would not cross in the pursuit of his dream.\n\nThe true secret, visible only in hindsight, was that to the self-proclaimed Regent those lines never existed in the first place.\n\nAs the shadows lengthened, those who were overtaken by the darkness sensed the beginning of something terrible. Dissidents, once arrested and put through due process, began to simply disappear. The faces of Taboritsky's soldiers hardened, taking on a cruel aspect. Instructions to the citizenry became increasingly terse and cold. People whispered fearful wisdom to one another, spreading tales of arbitrary punishments delivered without mercy or hesitation. Change came gradually, but the day on which a protest was met with phosgene gas and the deadly rattle of machine-guns was the final turning of the key.\n\nThe clock chimed a hollow note, hailing the dawn of a new day.

Perhaps they have earned their stays in jail.\n\nVologda's generals are characterized, much as their regime was, by a lack of ideological rigor. This quality led them to lay down their arms in the face of the German onslaught, suggesting that they may simply not be reliable for our future moves against the Reich. However, it could be that their decisions were simply made in the face of a collapsing WRRF, and their pragmatism is a worthy quality when serving under a government perpetually vexed by ideological radicalism.

Entrusting their ideological fellow travelers with our army may therefore prove a poor idea. Nevertheless, it should be noted that Vyatka was not an ideological monolith much as its White predecessors weren't, and that many of its ideologues, including some of the army, desired something akin to our own democracy.

One could very easily argue from a nationalistic or pragmatic point of view that empowering resitive minorities would only lead to instability in their home regions. From a humanistic perspective perhaps more in line with republican values, giving the Bashkirs concessions in the form of letting their generals serve may provide a very small smoothing of our relations with them.

 komicoup.1.d:0 "The relatively calm day in the city of Syktyvkar and the Republic's government was suddenly interrupted, as the supporters of the Left gathered around Suslov, and turned Komi's political landscape upside down by launching a coup.\n\nEarly in the morning, increased activity of leftist paramilitary units was reported, but no one could expect what happened next. Receiving orders from the puppet master of the Left, hundreds of fully equipped and well-trained troops converged on the capital of our Republic, heading for government buildings and the National Assembly itself. They met almost no resistance. Many were arrested, from prominent political opponents to right-wing sympathizers or even normal civilians. In the end, the troops all reached their final destination: the legislative building of the Republic.\n\nAt gunpoint, all members of parliament bar the most loyal Suslovites were swiftly arrested by the military, and the government body, effectively under the control of the putschists, was forced to obey their orders. The Constitution of the Komi Republic has been declared no longer effective, and a new constitution has been hastily drafted, marking the official creation of the Komi Socialist Republic. As for its leader, it is not the puppet master, Suslov himself. Instead, Boris Ponomaryov, well-known as his most trusted ally, has been appointed General Secretary. Suslov himself is merely the Premier of the Republic, preferring to control the new regime from behind the scenes.\n\nWhether the socialist experiment will succeed in Komi remains to be seen, but first, the Suslovite clique that has now seized control will need to properly assert it over the country. Resistance from the center and right will be at a disadvantage, as they now have to become insurgents against the authoritarian government. The next few days will be crucial for the Komi state."

 komicoup.2.d:0 "The first sign of trouble is when a Representative who leaves on smoke break doesn't come back to the Legislature on time. It's a common ailment for the smoke-lovers of the Republic: cigarette breaks last far longer than they should, partially because of the sheer difficulty of procuring sticks from the chaotic supply routes traceable to India and China. Every cigarette break is a luxury - to be savoured, not expended.\n\nEven so, a cigarette break is physically incapable of lasting for a full hour, and at 2:30 pm a search party is sent out to reprimand the Representative and get his voting record on the present Bill. Decorum is decorum, after all.\n\nIt is quite a surprise when the search party instead discovers armed men outside the doors of the Congress - as a furious scuffle begins between the reluctant gunmen and the furious Representatives, shots are fired into the air. Guards rush to the defense of the beleaguered politicians from within the chamber, and the session becomes an armed standoff between two very irate groups of ageing men and women.\n\nIt is comical, for about five minutes: then the armored column arrives. Red-stars splayed on their sides and banners waving from the hatches leave no doubt as to who masterminded this little action. From the first tank Zhdanov and Suslov clutch little ushankas. Zhdanov is yelling like a cowboy to the other tanks, almost exuberant, while Suslov is unnervingly silent. Crowds gather round the column, yelling slogans and waving banners of their own.\n\nAs the column aims their considerable armaments on the Parliament, options narrow and vanish. Army units refuse to assemble, or simply dissolve like snow at a fingernail touch. At precisely 3:18 pm the Komi Republic is dissolved - as honorary General Secretary, Zhdanov reads the first address of the newly formed Soviet Socialist Republic alongside his new premier, Suslov."

These general strikes are not met with immediate action, and Government representatives, for once, fail to show up to reassure the angry workers marching in the streets.\n\nNo one is precisely sure where the explosion of military support comes from, either - was it the patient work of the Commissars, or the spontaneous action of radical-sympathisers in the militias, or both? Either way, no one is surprised when military barricades set up to 'calm the workers and point them back home' simply join the demonstrations, riding the popular tide. Personnel carriers left abandoned by their sides are commandeered as vanguards, their sides festooned with red flags as they move into the Capital.\n\nThe final attempt to rebuff the wave of popular dissent comes in front of the Legislature itself, which is currently in session. The armed escort of guards suddenly seems small next to the crowds that have swelled into the streets, their presence almost minimal. As the workers demand an entry into Congress to air their views on several pressing workers' rights issues, a gunshot is fired from an unknown source.\n\nHistory's wheels are spurred into action.\n\nThe rush into the building is quick, even if it is violent at times: workers drag assemblymen out of their seats, some still struggling with their captors, and atop the podium Svetlana Bukharina is proclaimed new Premier of the Komi Soviet Socialist Republic. A slyly smiling Bukharina is called in on one of her rare rest-days, formally asked to take on an terribly confused Suslov, and the Worker's Action ends with its ringleaders in equal triumph and disarray."

Those who questioned the instruction to stay indoor and find shelter were beaten. A few citizens of the capital were simply dragged into waiting cars and disappeared by the men in uniform.\n\nHuddled and waiting, with every radio frequency jammed, the citizens of Syktyvkar waited. The end of the air raid sirens did not coax them out of hiding. Only a few brave or foolish runners could be seen in each district, their coming and going observed by the unknown men.\n\nThe news only brought more questions to the paranoid atmosphere of the Capital. Men loyal to Ivan Serov had stormed the legislature before it could break for lunch. Decrying the democratic and communist politicians both as traitors willing to stand aside as other warlords plot the end of Syktyvkar, the paramilitaries forced a dissolution of the government at gunpoint. Ivan Serov was sworn in as emergency ruler, legally entitled to defend a new Ordosocialist constitution.\n\nThe citizens of the republic were used to propaganda, and learning between the lines was the only way to stay informed. The new government's forceful declaration that "traitorous and degenerate political leaders'' all await execution in a safe location have little credibility in the absence of evidence. Rumors ran of various communist and democratic leaders having escaped the coup, and of far right elements lurking in the shadows to end this new ordosocialist government. But the element of surprise for the day was Serov's, and so this new "national worker's state" is free to take its first few steps into the wider world, a chimera of komi's far left and right."

Armed troopers secured each bridge over the Vychegda River, disarming surprised garrisons without violence. WRRF soldiers on the far side looked on as one group soldier tried to make a stand, only to see its position shelled by mortar fire. Soon after, the trickle of soldiers turned into a flood. The government's soldiers were boxed into their barracks as democratic militias invaded the capital. Leading the offensive were the elite Republican Guard, the best trained defenders of the former democratic government. The Guard's IFVs had cordoned off the legislative assembly by the second hour of the invasion. No politicians were in the assembly at that time of the day, of course; they were hiding somewhere in Syktyvkar. Not that it mattered, for the streets were now littered with checkpoints. There would be time enough for the extremists to be found.\n\nThe Republican Guards's technical experts swiftly overtook every strong radio station in town. The same message was put on loop, informing citizens that the previous government had been an illegal affront to the democratic ideals that every man and woman of Komi should adhere to. The Republic would be restored by a government of national reconstruction , the message informed them, with Svetlana Stalina being given emergency power as a president. Thus equipped, the president will be able to quash any extremist threatening the republic's most cherished ideals of democracy and progress. Stalina, the message concluded, would not rest until Komi had stabilized enough to see its constitution restored."

Even the river was taken over, as men on boats prevented anyone from taking to their vessels. From there, they too came to assist their comrades.\n\nThe swiftness of their arrival and of their advances caught the forces of the current government off guard. Police were neutralized. And any response by the city's own garrison was met with a greater one. In no time, they were turned.\n\nSeconds turned to minutes. And now, the whole city was secured. Patrols now raced to capture the city hall, leaving bodies and spent casings in their wake. Without their security forces, the current government was no more. Forced to surrender at gunpoint, officials abandoned their buildings, hands up as they streamed into waiting trucks. Those who resisted were beaten into compliance or shot for ceaseless defiance.\n\nBut at last, they have done it. The restoration of the Republic was accomplished, punctuated by the broad declaration of a state of emergency. Soon enough, the victorious Republican Guard and their supporters made ready to greet their returning President.\n\nFrom the steps of the hall of Syktyvkar, the legitimate government can begin its term.

But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."

There had been a time, she reminisced, when she would have considered that a personal failing - one that she would need to rectify through whatever means she could pull out of her repertoire of learned and tested stratagems.\n\nBut it was no matter. It was difficult to make use of her previous tricks in this grey Hell.\n\nHer objective had been sighted in just the sort of circumstance she expected. Down the hall from her cell was the blocks they used for solitary confinement - blocks that she occasionally heard faint screams from. Screams that made her grit her teeth, and pace across the few square meters of space that she had been permitted by the Government's mercy. In the time she had spent to stare through the bars at the corridor, she had seen two guards dragging a short woman between them, away from solitary - a woman who still extruded an aura of ashen defiance and faded passion. A woman who she had known all too well.\n\nIn the distant past, she had considered eventually breaking her will as a sad inevitability, something that had to be done to realize her vision. But looking into her eyes whilst she had been dragged down the corridor betrayed a different outcome than the one she had expected. Whilst her infamous stark white suits had long been replaced by prison orange, whilst her formerly disciplined and tightly bound hair hung loose and unkempt, Svetlana Stalina was unbowed and unbroken. The Lady of Steel, it seemed, had merely been tempered, and not shattered.\n\nAs she passed on down the corridor, and out of view, Bukharina felt a thin smile cross her face. They may have been bitter foes - opponents that both recognized the other would have to go in order to build the future they desired. But, in the end, in the shadows of both of their defeats, she felt nothing but pride at her former enemy's defiance, and a resolve to adhere to the same standard."

Her vision for socialism is the true successor to her father's Soviet Union, and I will not stand by and let Zhdanov's reactionary tendencies lead our revolution astray. I feel that," Furtseva repeatedly glanced at Zhdanov as she spoke, "I feel that Bukharina's awareness of the oppression that many citizens of the former Soviet Union faced is crucial to our movement's survival. Women, Komi, Tatars, and all of the other marginalized groups within the shattered Union must become true members of the revolution! We must embrace them with open arms, not shun them for not being Russian!

This question had stumped the Chairwoman for a few minutes now.\n\nLooking into her past, Furtseva had first gained the Communist Party's attention by writing a scathing critique of a film displayed in a Syktyvkar theater and its satire of the former Soviet Union's leadership. She called for the Communist Party to boycott the theater until it cut all ties with the film's director and stopped displaying the film. It had worked, and she was elected to the former Republic's National Assembly later that year. Furtseva had arrived before Bukharina's popularity surged, and had already allied with Zhdanov when Bukharina arrived in Syktyvkar. This past could mean that she was a reformist, and renounced Zhdanov when it became clear that Bukharina was the real force for reform within Syktyvkar. Alternatively, she was always an Ultravisionary, and was working with Zhdanov to undermine Bukharina.\n\nFurtseva clearly cared about cultural matters, and clearly wanted to ensure that revolutionary ideals properly reached the public.

Evidently he had been sorely mistaken. While political status shouldn't determine employment, he felt that teachers should have standards about their biases. Whichever teacher was the subject of all these angry letters to his office evidently did not.\n\nHere was the problem. A number of parents were noticing that their children came home with... skewed understandings of Russian history. One letter described a seven year old who, upon being asked what she had learned in History that day replied that Russia had been a land of opportunity before Lenin had the tsar shot and brought women into the workplace. Another described a writing assignment apparently requesting that students "write about what the nation means to you, and what should be done to those who don't respect it." There were eight similar letters, and as the school was legally required to be politically impartial, something had to be done about it.\n\nSorokin started by requesting that Nadya look into the teachers' backgrounds, and she quickly came back with a likely suspect. Viktor Bugakov, a history teacher for six months, had both a criminal record and an OVRI membership card.

It had become a widely cherished children's book in areas of Russia still controlled by communists, and even among the communists in Syktyvkar. It was a story of a young communist boy named Timur and his friends helping the public and furthering the revolution in any way he could... and it was all based on him. Timur Gaidar had once been the very boy that Arkady Gaidar had modeled the Timur of the book off of.\n\nIt was incredible to think of how long ago it had been published. 1940, a year before the invasion. He had been a young boy then, an eager Bolshevik, following in his father's footsteps. Now he served people his father would angrily declare traitors to the revolution. Ah, revolution. What a joke.

Outside, the bustle of daily activity was winding down, at this hour between lunch and late afternoon.\n\nThe pair had spent most of the day exploring the Burnside problem, and others like it in group theory. Would a finitely generated group in which elements have finite order would be a finite group? Intuition seemed to say yes. How could finite elements of limited scope generate that which is boundless? Yet, naive intuition was dangerous to any mathematician. Now, the algebraists had an angle of attack toward building a counter-example. For a given field, an infinite dimensional quotient group could be built under certain conditions. From there, solving Burnside's problem was much simplified; all one had to do was create such a quotient group generated by finitely many elements of finite order. This would warrant at least some interest in Russia's dwindling mathematical community. Perhaps in the outer world, someday?\n\nVerifications were moving ahead rapidly. Golod leaned back into his chair, the warmness of the tea mixing with the satisfaction of work well done. In this instant it was so easy to imagine a path not travelled, a Russia not ravaged by war, not divided by scheming generals and politicians.

This group consisted of the elements of the Weil-Châtelet group of a number field K that are trivial within all completions of K.

The only weapon was being held by the men guarding his car, firmly out of sight. No man could see the General Secretary of the Communist Party standing before a single grave under the oak tree.\n\nYelizaveta had been the greatest thing to happen to Suslov, and she was gone. Mikhail Suslov had not been surprised, but that didn't make it hurt any less. He had been forced to watch his wife grow feebler and weaker as her illness progressed, powerless to intervene. Try as hard as he might, Suslov was no match against Death itself.\n\nAs the first drops began to fall upon the grass around him, Suslov wiped his eyes and placed his flowers down next to her headstone.

The polling data was looking shaky, and the RNP had lost two seats to the PSD over the past month, as their poll numbers tanked due to local scandals. As Igor Shafarevich's campaign manager, it was his job to ensure that his party's candidates could actually be elected, but the Passionariyy-affiliated parties didn't make that easy.\n\nVoters didn't tend to respond well to overt racism. It was as simple as that. He would tell candidates this. Then, they would go on stage.... and start ranting about Jews and small nations, and Volkov would have to just sit there and watch the ship sink before his very eyes. He originally had worked with the entirety of the Passionariyy Society, but recently he had decided to focus on the mainstream wing of the party - Shafarevich's Russian National Party. They could at least hide their intentions, and Volkov was at least skilled enough to get people to listen to Shafarevich.\n\nGetting the Passionarriy into the Assembly was not an easy task, but Leonid Volkov wouldn't let that stop him. People responded well to anti-communist rhetoric, they responded well to their economic policies, and they responded well to Russian nationalism. If he could keep Shafarevich and his peers to continue walking the narrow line, Volkov could work miracles.\n\nVolkov then had a realization. Volkov was crucial to getting Shafarevich elected. Shafarevich was crucial to the rest of the Passionariyy. Therefore, Volkov could probably get himself a raise."

He had told Shafarevich to focus on the failures of the Coalition and the economy, but Morozov had brought up Shafarevich's small nation concept. Shafarevich then decided to explain the concept, and it wasn't exactly flattering for the RNP. Volkov had thought that Morozov was just a token representative, but it appears the Komi politicians was more skilled than he had thought.\n\nThis was not the apocalypse however. Sure, data looked poor after the debate, but Volkov had a procedure for these types of situations.\n\nFirst, Radio Free Syktyvkar. Ivanov and Ivanov were the best free advertising money couldn't buy, but if he slipped them a few "donations" he could certainly get them to weave a new narrative. Voznesensky never failed to deliver a new scandal, and Ivan Ivanov could give Shafarevich a flattering, friendly interview, where Shafarevich could moderate his message for the public. Secondly, send out some press statements to the newspapers, and convince them that Shafarevich's words were taken out of context.\n\nOnce all of that had been done, get the public's attention onto someone else. One of his militias had found a KPK weapons stash near a Deputy's home, he could twist that into a proper scandal. As Volkov went over his plan, he knew this was salvageable. He started writing the first letters, and his new narrative began to take form."

The district's elections were a while away, but to steal this district things needed to be set in motion as soon as possible. The district's former deputy, a DSNP candidate, was not planning to run for re-election. His successor was sufficiently milquetoast, and Volkov could certainly find a more charismatic candidate. That wasn't the issue here. The real problem was that the district had a large minority demographic, mostly Jewish. The RNP wanted to marginalize this demographic, and ensure that the National Assembly was serving the Russian nation's best interests. To Volkov it was a noble goal, but a difficult one to get into the Assembly.\n\nObviously none of Gumilyov's Eurasianists would do. He found his man in the form of a Passionariyy Society member who owned a successful business in the district. He was a gregarious guy, and had even appeared on the radio once. That was the candidate settled. Next was the issue of demographics.\n\nVolkov wasn't sure how to get a majority in the district. Then, he realized that he didn't need a majority, just a plurality. Volkov just needed to make the district apathetic enough to lower turnout, all the while drumming up support behind his candidate. A smear campaign against the DSNP and their upcoming candidate would ensure that they were no threat, and soon the RNP would have that seat. Volkov pushed up his glasses. If he started now, this election could have effects even beyond this single district."

I would like to thank President Shafarevich for giving me the opportunity to speak today..." Igor smiled as Kuzmin glanced at him. The vice president was nothing if not an eager soul. "It is he, after all, that holds the sacred traditions of Russian culture to be among the most important aspects of our state. In this task, I have faithfully worked with him to build a better future for all Russians, while making sure to keep our past safe from dilution. Bad faith actors with no regard for our people who have infiltrated Russia have worked hard to build a certain narrative about our origins..."\n\nShafarevich felt his smile begin to fade ever so slightly. He didn't remember seeing this tangent in the script. Perhaps he forgot? "Indeed, a certain small nation would have you believe that the Russian people share blood with that of our adversaries, but what if I told you that these were nothing but disingenuous lies by the charlatans of the clergy? Our ancestors' roots grew deep, tempered by the blood of ancient Celts since time immemorial. If not for President Shafarevich..."\n\nShafarevich's mouth hung agape as the vice president continued. His expression had gone from cautious pride to that of sheer horror. He gestured across his neck as Kuzmin looked his way once more, clearly indicating his wish for the speech to come to an end."

Tabloids, radio talk shows, and word of mouth spread like wildfire as Orenburg was brought into the fold and to the surprise of no one, divided the people. However, despite the arguments for and against him, the general reaction seemed to be largely...muted. Indeed, despite the occasional group of workers or farmers voicing mild complaints, for the most part they were content with how he was running things. Burba didn't seem too aggravated by him, nor did he seem to be too much for him. If anything, the main reaction to his new hold over the Urals was- apathy."

The streets were taken to on occasion by protests, and though some welcomed the end of what they saw a tyrant, others- loyal to Malenkov's ideals, or loyal to the wealth and power they had had under him clashed and bickered.\n\nTo the credit of the new ruling government, they had done their best to slowly, carefully enter the region with an open hand and a welcome voice- but Orenburg was nowhere near as open to their thoughts as any optimist could have claimed."

A drunkard, a scandal-monger, and worst of all, a statist, this brutal authoritarian has shown the people of Orenburg the terrors of corruption, the terrors of racial hatred, and has attempted to force his statist views upon the communes. His ideals of "social democracy" appear to be solely dedicated to ending the anarchist cause, and decimating Orenburg's proud institutions as a whole. At least, that's what Orenburg says.\n\nWhile most in Syktyvkar have reacted to the newspaper headlines of riots and Zhdanov cocktails being tossed at policemen with a raised eyebrow and sigh, anti-anarchist sentiment is at its peak. Thankfully, the President's latest scandals have managed to be overlooked thanks to a few communal riots, and Nikolai is certain that in time, Orenburg will calm down."

Others however, told many stories of how he died, ranging from the mundane to the outlandishly bizarre- but all had one thing in common, and that was his death.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the Bandit King began to slowly fade as life returned to Orsk, championed by a president who was more than content to help people get over the horrors of the past, and remove the stain of the great terror of the Urals.\n\nIn the end, Oskar Direlwanger would become a small historical footnote, or on occasion the villain of a story, or tale.

After all these were lesser men, and lesser men did not understand great works. Lesser men did not understand sacrifice. All they understood was how to crave power, and how to make lengthy promises.

Mounted machine-guns ringed her hull, and a single 85mm cannon graced her front deck, taking up the majority of the available space. To the assembled military men, she was beautiful.

Yakovlev served in the Red Army during the German invasion, and the horrors he experienced on the Front, including almost losing an arm during the invasion.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fracturing of the country into multiple warlords, Yakovlev's life had been shattered, as the strength and truth of Marxist-Leninism right in front of his eyes. The destruction of his country and ideology forced him to look at Socialism through a different lens, one in which human happiness and quality of life trumped ideological purity.\n\nAfter winning a difficult election in the recently conquered Arkhangelsk Oblast against the wishes of the DSNP establishment, he has established himself as a prominent freshman in the Oblast.

He has been instrumental to the Democratic Front in helping ensure party loyalty among Deputies coming from the former Front and elsewhere. While technically coming from a new territory, Yakovlev has been succeeding in straddling the line between being associated either with the party establishment in Syktyvkar or the frontier, making himself out as a possible unifier in the young republic.\n\nHowever, his desire for compromise extends only so far, as many on the right of the DSNP are well aware. Yakovlev's public criticism of those in his own party who have 'betrayed our socialist roots' has made him popular among leftists in Komi. While his economic policies are far from radical in Russia, his forcefulness in such criticism has since made him a prominent member of the left of his party.\n\nWhile still young and inexperienced in the ways of government, it is expected among the party establishment that he will do great things."

 yakovlev.3.t:0 "The Red Star"
 yakovlev.3.d:0 "While still a moderately fresh face in politics, the Western Russian Free Republic's Alexander Yakovlev has made himself known as a man of the left in the People's Democratic Socialist Party. A powerful political operative, known for his reformist and socialist tendencies, Yakovlev has gained a following among younger intellectuals, working class trade unionists, and citizens of the Front territory, all of which have made him a powerful figure on the left wing of the party.\n\nWhile once a freshman Deputy from Korolyovo, he has since raised his status as a popular figure among socialists and other leftists within the DSNP, much to the chagrin of the party's right wing. With his fiery criticism of the right DSNP's liberal economic policies and a firebrand desire to uplift the working class of his nation through a newfound humanistic socialism, many expect Yakovlev to seek the Presidency.\n\nAlthough he has kept any hints of seeking the presidency to himself, it remains to be seen if Yakovlev's coalition can overcome the party establishment."

 yakovlev.4.t:0 "Voznesensky Announces Retirement!"
 yakovlev.4.d:0 "Shocking news coming from the Western Russian Free Republic today, as it's first and longest lasting President, Nikolai Voznesensky, has announced his retirement at the end of his term, and that he will not be seeking an additional term as President.\n\nOriginally elected in 1958 after spending a year as its head of state, President Voznesensky went on to be elected two more times in 1963 and 1967 by convincing margins under his leadership. While his popularity was far from what it once was, he has been able to keep the young and unstable Republic from breaking apart.\n\nVoznesensky has not explicitly endorsed a successor, although it is expected he is to endorse his Party's primary winner for the 1971 election. Many in the Republic, however, can not imagine another man to fill his shoes."

 yakovlev.5.t:0 "A Power Play"
 yakovlev.5.d:0 "To the surprise of everyone across the country and beyond, Alexander Yakovlev, a up and coming politician from the Arkhangelsk Oblast, has won the primary to be the candidate of the People's Democratic Socialist Party. Originally considered a dark horse candidate for the party, he narrowly beat out his moderate opponent.\n\nFor years, Yakovlev has been representing the DSNP's left wing for years, advocating for a stronger left wing economic policy, and has led the charge against the party's economic liberalization. This, combined with his support among the former Front held regions, has now catapulted him into his status as a major Presidential candidate.\n\nWhile many on the right of the DSNP grumble about Yakovlev, the center and left wing are openly congratulating the candidate on his victory, and are expected to have even greater representation in the National Assembly. Whether he can win the Presidency, however, remains to be seen."

While the right may balk at us, the workers of this nation know who their true enemy is."\n\nAlexander Yakovlev's speech officially announcing his candidacy for the President of the Komi Republic has been well received by many on the left wing of the Democratic Front and beyond. While his candidacy has just been announced, Yakovlev has met with many trade unionists in both core Komi territory and in former Front territory, which were all met with positivity among working class voters and trade union bureaucracy.\n\nWhile many considered Alexander Yakovlev to be a dark horse in the People's Democratic Socialist Party's primary, his unexpected victory has since capitulated his already impressive political record to new heights. His powerful political connections in the Front's former territory, in addition to his harsh criticism of the right wing of his party, has made him the darling of the left within the Komi Republic. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can succeed his predecessor in maintaining order and stability within our young nation."

 katushev.1.d:0 "With the recent integration of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly known as Gorky, into the Republic, it was considered essential to establish legitimate governance within both it and the surrounding region.\n\nElections for all positions, legislative and executive, were therefore announced and subsequently held. Although many races were competitive, one in particular - the Governor's - was not. Konstantin Katushev, a local engineer and industrialist, and notable for his long-standing support of and advocacy for broadly liberal policies, won by a considerable margin.\n\nKatushev, who entered the regional political sphere as soon as he was able, quickly negotiated with and secured the endorsement of the SMR, commonly known as the Young Reformers, and began proclaiming their general position to the electorate. Proving himself an exceptionally skilled political organizer, he quickly established both a robust and rapidly expanding political infrastructure, greatly expanding local awareness of and support for democratic ideals.\n\nThis infrastructure proved an insurmountable challenge for his opponents, as though several other campaigns outspent Katushev by a considerable margin, none were able to significantly challenge the increasing momentum displayed by his own.\n\nExperts agree that the 'Iron Governor,' as he has been increasingly referred to, is likely to leverage that infrastructure in order to further establish Nizhny Novgorod as a stronghold, both for the Reformers and for their political adherents."
 katushev.1.a:0 "A rising star, indeed."
 
 katushev.2.t:0 "The Party Machine"
 katushev.2.d:0 "As was previously predicted by experts, the continued efforts of the SMR-aligned 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, to establish Nizhny Novgorod as a bastion of liberal idealism have shown results.\n\nOnce again demonstrating a profound talent for organization, Katushev moved quickly following his election to identify local allies, particularly among those who carefully concealed democratic leanings under the former regime, and then appoint them to politically influential positions. Although many of these allies have been criticized by Katushev's opponents as inexperienced and 'eccentric,' counting among their number political novices from numerous menial careers, their inclusion has won Katushev the support of many within the city.\n\nWhile tirelessly working to continuously further expand the political infrastructure established during his election campaign, Katushev has begun to apply that infrastructure in support of the candidacy of other SMR prospects. Indeed, many of the city's National Assembly districts are now held by SMR deputies, and experts predict that the degree of support extended by Katushev's machine is such that they are unlikely to be unseated by their many opponents anytime soon.\n\nUnder Katushev, Nizhny Novgorod has very quickly become a political bastion of the Young Reformers, and the influence of this fact on the political landscape of the Republic as a whole is expected to grow in the months and years ahead."
 katushev.2.a:0 "A beacon of liberalism."

 katushev.3.t:0 "From Oblast to Nation"
 katushev.3.d:0 "The political influence of Nizhny Novgorod, as one of the largest cities in Western Russia and thus the source of a significant proportion of the National Assembly's deputies, has continued to grow. As has the influence of its 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev.\n\nKatushev's now-extensive political infrastructure and, consequently, his ability to mobilize support for the SMR within the region has led to other parties being all but shut out of its Assembly delegation. Indeed, deputies from Katushev's 'domain' now constitute a considerable portion of the entire Young Reformer caucus, affecting the party's viewpoint as a whole. Recognizing this, the SMR has begun shifting more and more of its administrative organs, other than those required in Syktyvkar itself, to the city.\n\nA corollary to this shift in both caucus demographics and organization is the rapidly increasing influence of Katushev within the party on the national level. He has reportedly begun making 'suggestions' on electoral and positional policy, and it is considered likely that other figures within the SMR's senior leadership will be unable to resist them.\n\nAmong oppositional party organizers, consensus has therefore been reached that Katushev is to be considered a critical and near-irreplaceable figure within the SMR, and he has been identified as a prime candidate for potential party leadership in the near future."

 katushev.4.t:0 "Kosygin Announces Retirement"
 katushev.4.d:0 "Earlier today, President Alexei Kosygin announced that he would not seek re-election upon the expiration of his current term, and would instead be retiring from political life.\n\nIn a brief speech, Kosygin made the proclamation while speaking about his personal political journey, from his time spent in the Soviet state apparatus to his arrival in the Republic and later foundation of the Young Reformers. He exhorted the Republic and Assembly to remain true to the principles of democracy and liberalism on which he was elected, and emphasized to his eventual successor the importance of rejecting radicalism of all types within the national political discourse. He subsequently ended his speech with thanks to his many political allies and other confederates.\n\nWhile some experts had correctly theorized the purpose of Kosygin's speech, most appeared to have been taken by some degree of surprise. Whatever the criticisms held by opponents against Kosygin, and they were many, all could generally agree that he had long desired to see political stability in the Republic.\n\nWhether the race for the Presidency, which has been galvanized by the announcement, will possess such stability is currently unknown."
 katushev.4.a:0 "The end of an era."

 katushev.5.t:0 "The New Reformer"
 katushev.5.d:0 "The meteoric rise of the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Katushev, has continued unabated as he has recently secured the leadership of the SMR as a whole and thus, its official nomination for the upcoming Presidential election.\n\nLeveraging his enormous personal support and political influence within Nizhny Novgorod in the wake of President Alexei Kosygin's recent announcement of retirement, he moved quickly to position himself as a candidate for succession. Although other senior party figures soon did the same, much as it did in his earlier gubernatorial election, Katushev's early advantage and quick action proved decisive, and he was elected leader of the SMR on the first ballot.\n\nThis surprised many observers, who were expecting multiple rounds of negotiation by candidates among the SMR caucus. However, as was evidenced, the increasing degree of party centrality upon Nizhny Novgorod overwhelmingly favored Katushev, and support for other contenders was seen to quickly collapse among the contingents of SMR deputies not already from districts in or around the city.\n\nHaving secured his party's nomination, Katushev is soon, along with the candidates put forward by other parties, expected to begin his national campaign for the presidency. While many have expressed certainty that the policies of the Young Reformers are likely to find little support outside urban centres, others have been quick to identify Katushev's skills at attractively packaging SMR ideology.\n\nOnly time will tell which opinion proves correct."

 katushev.6.t:0 "A Revolutionary Platform"
 katushev.6.d:0 "Konstantin Katushev, known nationally as the 'Iron Governor' and the SMR's nominee for President, today officially launched his campaign in his personal and party stronghold of Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nSurprising many, his commencement speech made no mention of socialist concepts, long considered a cornerstone of SMR ideology. Instead, Katushev spoke strongly in the support of promoting national modernization through comprehensive programs of ecological conservation, the enshrinement of meritocratic principles in both public and private sectors, and in promoting general economic prosperity through the invitation of foreign investment and bilateral trade.\n\nPolitical pundits were quick to respond, with those sympathetic to the SMR praising Katushev's speech as a focused vision for Russia's future. Those opposed were equally quick in decrying it as a thinly veiled attempt to conceal the 'fundamentally socialist' nature of any SMR policies from rural voting blocs.\n\nRegardless of expert interpretation, however, Katushev's speech drew intense interest from many communities across the Republic, urban and rural alike, and the SMR was quick to capitalize on this by issuing an immediate appeal for both the recruitment of local campaign organizers and of general fundraising.\n\nThough a long campaign remains, and none can yet be sure of the election's eventual outcome, Katushev and the Young Reformers have managed to secure a strong starting position."

 komilaws.1.d:0 "The Komi Republic, unlike many of the warlord states that have spread across the old Soviet Union, is blessed with a formal governmental and economic system. However, this does not entail stability or any sort of expedience in the National Assembly's budgetary machinations.\n\nThe so-called Voznesentsi, the ruling party in the governing coalition of the Republic, have prepared a budget for the year, a comprehensive initiative focused on external defense, internal policing, and public welfare to repair the damages caused by the bombings. However, internal polling reveals a rather concerning trend within the coalition - with our current number of 'confirmed' votes it seems that if any more dissensions at all are to take place within the governing coalition, the budget will fail, and the Republic's government will be paralyzed for months.\n\nIn the wake of the discovery of this distressing trend within the party, the President of the Republic has been forced to make a decision. The budget could be handed to Alexei Kosygin, leader of the "Young Reformists" Party and talented economist, or it could be kept as-is, and strings pulled to ensure that the vote goes our way. While Kosygin is slightly to the right of the President, his influence could ensure that the budget passes safely and comfortably, evading an embarassing government failure or shutdown."

The DSNP and PSD lack the necessary votes to pass the budget through the National Assembly on their own, and Voznesensky's budgetary proposals of shifting funds from internal spending to military production has left the SMR unwilling to back the bill, which they claim abandon the ideals of the true people's revolution to cater to Stalina and the opposition parties. To pass the bill, there are two proposed strategies. Either roll back some of the proposals to get Kosygin's party back on board, or try to get Zhdanov's faction of the KPK to vote with the government by promising the military contracts will be awarded to council-run industries associated with his support base.

More worryingly, multiple members of the Assembly from our coalition parties have stated they will vote with the Passionariyy against the budget should it fail to reassure them it is not the result of a backroom deal with the communists. Well, we'll have to reassure them, failure of the budget is not an option."

The right wingers are now confident they defeated communist collusion with the DSNP, not realizing the actual backroom deal regarded which factories get the production contracts. A few choice cuts to non-essential services like library funding and housing acquisition brought them on board with the new budget. With the support of both the communists and the right, it won't matter if some SMR representatives won't back the bill over the internal spending cuts."

Alexei Kosygin of the Union of Young Reformers was highly critical of the bill for its cuts to internal spending, particularly on social security, and almost two thirds of the party's representatives refused to vote for it. That is when the Communist Party unexpectedly came to the President's rescue, the majority of their representatives voting for the new budget on grounds of its importance in protecting national industry and securing the Revolution.\n\nThe budget thus passed with a comfortable majority, and President Voznesensky is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those opponents who supported the bill. All may however not be a bed of roses for the President in the future, as Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich have issued a joint press statement that they will conduct a thorough internal investigation on both of the members of Shafarevich' circle who backed the bill without checking it for communist infiltration, and of the government's own potential collaboration with the KPK.

Lacking the necessary majority to challenge the bill, the opposition could do little but protest as it passed through the Assembly with great aplomb.

While the bill was initially heavily criticized by the coalition partners for focusing heavily on national security and internal stability issues, the President has clearly made her partners come round to her way of thinking.

The problem is that if we follow the recommendation of the democratic coalition partners and commit to this without compensating for the very likely possibility of going over our very limited budget, we risk running up debt, which is notoriously expensive due to our isolation from international credit. Yegor Ligachev of the DSNP believes he has found a solution after receiving assurances from Zhdanov that the KPK will vote in support of any increase in income taxes necessary to fund the Infrastructure Repair Bill. This will however be highly unpopular both with the people and with the democratic centre. The Passionaries on the other hand want to ensure the repairs are done within budget by utilizing our thousands of prison inmates as unpaid workers.

As such, the Communist Party has introduced a bill enshrining the right of the natives to have a number of Assembly seats proportional to their population in the Republic, as well as a guaranteed right to jobs in the government of majority native municipalities. Needless to say, passing this bill would strengthen the Communists considerably, as they are already doing well among the natives and this bill would enshrine them as the party of native rights. As such, the Passionaries want the bill voted down, on the grounds of mandatory native representation being undemocratic in a system preaching one man, one vote. Of course, in reality their chief concern is the threat a strengthened Communist Party could present. As a compromise, the native Komi SMR representative Ivan Morozov has drafted a bill that would guarantee the natives access to local government and a heavier vote weight in Assembly elections, but no mandatory lower limit on native representation. The Center have rallied around this proposal, though many in the SMR and DSNP are clearly more sympathetic to the Communist's Mandated Minority Representation Bill. What will the Assembly conclude?"

Now, however, in an unusual act of cooperation, the Communists have endorsed a bill first introduced by the Passionariyy suggesting an alternative four year conscription system, albeit with a provision for lowered recruiting standards to ensure a bulkier army. With this alliance, and the risk of more conservative PSD members defecting to vote with the Passionariyy, there's a very real chance the two-year model is under threat.

Now, of course, it is very possible that some districts may be more equal than others, and should we desire to instead benefit one of the opposition factions for the purposes of our plans, it can easily be done by adding a provision allowing for smaller districts either in city centers, benefitting the KPK, or the suburban regions and smaller towns, benefitting the Passionariyy.

 komi_zhdanov_demand.4.d:0 "Voznesensky entered his office, and noticed an unmarked letter on his desk. He cautiously opened the letter, and began to read. Voznesensky knew immediately that Zhdanov had another demand to ask of him:\n\n'To my dearest friend, Voznesensky,\nI feel that Syktyvkar has been corrupted by greed. They need an example, a leader to show them the virtue of charity. I have gone through the trouble of selecting a suitable organization. I feel that in order to make the message hit closer to home, that the donation should be equivalent to USD $10,000,' that was a lot of money to simply donate out of the blue, Zhdanov was clearly getting more ambitious with his demands, 'I hope you make the right choice. Sincerely, your friend Zhdanov.'\n\nThe charity Zhdanov had selected was owned by a family with personal ties to Svetlana Bukharina. If Voznesensky accepted the demand, he might as well have been paying the Communist Party directly. Of course, Voznesensky wasn't stupid. If he refused, Zhdanov would surely release his kompromat on him. He pulled the checkbook out of a drawer in his desk, but paused as he uncapped his pen. Should he do what was best for himself, or should he do what was best for the Republic? If the information in that kompromat was released, Voznesesnky's career was probably over. With quivering hands, he put the nib to the paper, and watched the ink flow."

After several long, pained minutes, he opened the letter to see what that accursed Zhdanov wanted from him this time. They were supposed to be friends, and had been for years. Why would he keep treating him like this? He read the letter, and leaned back in his chair with a pained groan.\n\nIncreased press freedom. Could have been worse. An end to persecution of radical left journalists. Not ideal, but fair enough, leaving them alone might even make them less prone to calling for violence against the government."

The President has been forced to admit to a longtime friendship with the communist, which has earned him some begrudging respect from the Kosygin and the KPK, but caused a serious loss of authority within his own party, criticism from the PSD, and outright anger and distrust from the Passionariyy. This is definitely a loss of face."

This will seriously hurt our position going into the next election, especially as the Passionariyy are shouting from the rooftops about how this collaboration clearly went further, perhaps into the realm of illegality and unconstitutional behavior.

The leaks allege, and prove with several hours worth of audio tape, pictures, and official government papers, that President Voznesetsky have been involved in abuse of his position from the very beginning of his presidency in order to cut deals with the Communist Party for votes and possibly personal favors. Some of the actions, like the awarding of supposedly open contracts to communist-affiliated cooperatives, are flat out illegal. The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionariyy, while the coalition is reeling. The KPK, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrei Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the 'gifts' from the President were done illegally.

Poor, trusting man. You never had it in you to fully separate public and private life."\n\nHis smile faded.

 komidiplo.1.t:0 "Komi Requests Closer Relations"
 komidiplo.1.d:0 "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today. Ever since the so-called Komi Republic illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"
 komidiplo.1.a:0 "Let us bury the hatchet, and pursue warmer relations with the Republic."
 komidiplo.1.b:0 "These splitters have the gall to come crawling back? Ignore them."

 komidiplo.2.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. They have agreed to pursue warmer relations with our Republic. The current hostility between our governments shall cease, and communism shall once more present a united front against fascism! We are glad to see that our fellow comrades will not let bad blood betray the Revolution. Hopefully this is just the start of a mutually beneficial relationship between our two governments..."
 komidiplo.2.a:0 "We are glad that cooler heads have won the day."

 komidiplo.3.t:0 "A Split Front"
 komidiplo.3.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. Unfortunately, it seems their government still sees us as hostile to their cause. They have denounced our government as illegal splitters who betrayed the Front in Russia's darkest hour. The West Russian Revolutionary Front have effectively barred our diplomats from their government, and some advisors believe war may be on the horizon."
 komidiplo.3.a:0 "It seems old grudges are more important to them than the Revolution."

 komidiplo.4.t:0 "Shared Training Exercises?"
 komidiplo.4.d:0 "Ever since we began pursuing peaceful relations with the Komi Republic, their diplomats have become frequent visitors to Arkhangelsk. Today their message is different, however. The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources. However if we refuse we may offend the Komi government and risk damaging relations irreparably. Do we accept the request?"
 komidiplo.4.a:0 "Cross-training our troops can only be beneficial to our goals."

Several officers have arrived in preparation for the shared training exercises, much to the delight of our government. Hopefully their advice will aid in raising the effectiveness of our military, and provide new insight into military doctrine that our officers may have neglected. Of course, we shall send over several of our own officers immediately, as agreed upon. It seems our relationship with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is beginning to bear fruit..."

 komidiplo.6.t:0 "The Front Declines"
 komidiplo.6.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, bearing a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Their government claims they can not spare the manpower to undergo shared training exercises, as they claim to require every officer they can get their hands on. Their government apologizes for their refusal, but claim their hands are tied, and such a request simply isn't feasible at this time."
 komidiplo.6.a:0 "Hopefully they may change their minds in the future..."

 komidiplo.7.t:0 "Komi Requests an Alliance"
 komidiplo.7.d:0 "Diplomats from Syktyvkar once again come to our government bearing a request. The Komi Republic requests a formal guarantee from our government, to last until the threat of reactionaries is purged from the immediate area. They wish to ensure the safety of their people, and believe our military could provide the defenses necessary to secure the Republic's position.\n\nSome within our government believe we can't afford to defend both Komi's territory and our own, and that we must decline such a request at this time. They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one. Others within our government believe guaranteeing the Komi Republic's safety could allow us to gain a valuable and trusted ally, and that our military is large enough to spare the men and equipment for such a request."
 komidiplo.7.a:0 "A formal guarantee is in our best interests, tell them we shall protect each other."
 komidiplo.7.b:0 "We can not afford to defend them, they must secure their position themselves."

 komidiplo.8.t:0 "Mutual Protection"
 komidiplo.8.d:0 "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear good news. The West Russian Revolutionary Front has agreed to formally guarantee our government. This mutual protection guarantee will place our Republic in a much safer and stronger position. We are glad our allies are willing to cooperate to such an extent, and this partnership has once again proven its worth. In such turbulent times, it is comforting to know that we have such a dependable ally backing us."
 komidiplo.8.a:0 "We are now a truly united front!"

 komidiplo.9.t:0 "Alone Once More"
 komidiplo.9.d:0 "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear bad news. It appears the West Russian Revolutionary Front has refused our request for a formal guarantee of our safety. They claim to be unable to spare the manpower and equipment to defend us at the moment. Not only is our government disappointed by this decision, this decision has disappointed the people of our Republic. If the West Russian Revolutionary Front can't commit to defending their allies, then why ally with them at all? Maybe they will change their minds in the future, but as it stands relations with Arkhangelsk have taken a heavy blow."

Ever since they managed to secure their rule over their own borders, the leftists that finally dominated politics in Syktyvkar have turned outwards, and now seek to expand in the rest of Russia. Of course, we are a hurdle to their expansion, but they have not immediately taken up their arms to invade.\n\nAn offer has been made, and that is for our two republics to merge into one. According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again. We need to make a choice, or else we will soon have none"

After seeing the advantages we have to offer, and how successful we have been, it would be logical for any warlord regime to join us. And they, despite their suspected anti-communist sentiments seeing as they were a despotist military junta, have accepted. As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."

But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time. At least, that's what the High Command claims. Thus, we can no longer delay the invasion of Vologda."

Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."

Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armoured fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t:0 "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d:0 "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."

 komidiplo.20.t:0 "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d:0 "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a:0 "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b:0 "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.d:0 "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t:0 "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d:0 "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."

It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."

 komidiplo.24.d:0 "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a:0 "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t:0 "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d:0 "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."

In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."

It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."

They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react.

Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long.

Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a:0 "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.31.b:0 "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 
 komidiplo.32.t:0 "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d:0 "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a:0 "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t:0 "Bashkiria Agrees to Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a:0 "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t:0 "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d:0 "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a:0 "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b:0 "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t:0 "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d:0 "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a:0 "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t:0 "Vyatka Refuses Our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d:0 "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a:0 "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.t:0 "The West Russian United Front?"
 komidiplo.55.d:0 "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."
 komidiplo.55.a:0 "Pah! We will go our own way!"
 komidiplo.55.b:0 "Let us merge the two governments."
 
 komidiplo.58.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.58.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, our scouts have observed an increase of military activity on our borders with the state known as "Ust-Sysolsk"; a highly militaristic, far-right regime based in the lands formerly owned by the Komi Republic. The belligerent attitude this regime has held towards their neighbors has been cause for concern, and now it seems they are turning our sights towards our holy order.\n\nA message has been received this morning demanding our immediate submission. Should we accept, they would peacefully integrate our order into Ust-Sysolsk and bloodshed would be avoided at the expense of our own freedom. On the other hand, should we decline, it seems clear they would not shy away from military action..."
 komidiplo.58.a:0 "We have no choice but to submit."
 komidiplo.58.b:0 "These heretics do not deserve our fear!"

 komidiplo.59.t:0 "The Order Submits!"
 komidiplo.59.d:0 "As expected, the Order of Saint George has wilted in the face of our military might and decided it would be best to submit rather than risk a military confrontation. Our troops are already moving across the border into Gayny to ensure the integration process goes smoothly and without incident."
 komidiplo.59.a:0 "One more step on the road to unification."

 komidiplo.60.t:0 "The Order Stands Defiant!"
 komidiplo.60.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Order of Saint George has refused our demands and stands defiant even in the face of our overwhelming martial superiority. They are already reinforcing their borders and preparing for the inevitable conflict, but this effort is almost certainly futile. Our forces outnumber theirs by a considerable margin, and this war is not likely to take long."
 komidiplo.60.a:0 "Brave, but foolish."

 komidiplo.61.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.61.d:0 "Trouble on the horizon. The far-right regime based in Syktyvkar has long been a source of concern for us, and it seems their attention has finally been drawn to our neutral zone. Large forces of troops are massing on the border, and this worrying turn of events has coincided with a message to our foreign office.\n\nThe so-called state of "Ust-Sysolsk" demands the neutral zone's immediate submission and integration into their borders. Should we refuse, they have vaguely implied some kind of military action. Judging by the large presence of troops on our border, this threat is hardly a bluff. Shall we surrender and put the final nail in the neutral zone's coffin, or attempt to defend ourselves?"
 komidiplo.61.a:0 "We cannot possibly win. We must submit."
 komidiplo.61.b:0 "The neutral zone cannot fall!"
 
 komidiplo.62.t:0 "Vologda Submits!"
 komidiplo.62.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified. "
 komidiplo.62.a:0 "Neutrality is overrated."

 komidiplo.63.t:0 "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d:0 "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a:0 "We will crush them!"

 komidiplo.64.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d:0 "Worrying news from our supposed "allies" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a:0 "We never should've trusted them!"

 komidiplo.65.t:0 "Ust-Sysolsk Demands Our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d:0 "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."
 komidiplo.65.a:0 "Perhaps it is time to lay down our arms..."
 komidiplo.65.b:0 "We shall crush them beneath our treads!"

 komidiplo.66.t:0 "Gorky Surrenders!"

 komidiplo.66.a:0 "How fortuitous."

 komidiplo.67.t:0 "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."

 komidiplo.68.t:0 "A Letter to Tartarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d:0 "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tartarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, "much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."
 komidiplo.68.a:0 "God Willing, may our union bring glory to us both."
 komidiplo.68.b:0 "Rebuff these fools. Their words mean little."

 komidiplo.69.t:0 "The Instrument of Accession"
 komidiplo.69.d:0 "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."

 komidiplo.70.t:0 "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d:0 "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only "natural political and cultural concerns" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a:0 "They will come to regret this."

 komidiplo.71.t:0 "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d:0 "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common "base of faith, tolerance and ardor" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a:0 "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b:0 "We stand alone!"
 
 komidiplo.72.t:0 "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d:0 "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a "staunch brotherhood and mutual respect" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"

 komidiplo.73.d:0 "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the "spittle of Satan", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."

Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."

As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"

They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them."\n\n"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar."\n\n"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war."\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."

We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior Generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous, Socialist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing Socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to Socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism.

 komi_socdem.1.d:0 "Rodionov gazed at the hulking shell of the factory, lost as ever in thought. He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] had sent him here, on this 'fact-finding mission', to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins?

The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry.

Truth be told, that was probably the only reason why it got as far as his door in the first place - the DSNP had gotten past its worst day, but a residue of suspicion seemed to taint everything past the office doors these days. Even so, once the letter made it to [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to 'speak' directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

"Alexei, I believe we have certain concerns your Union has failed to address - I am not a man enamoured of warding off the inevitable, so let us try again. Will you, or will you not, stand for a work-week reduction?"\n\nThe Unionist sighed, trotting out the same words he'd always trotted out to the faux-benevolent. "With all due respect, Mr. President, you simply don't understand the material conditions here. We are already treading on the ragged edge of our employers, and it would not do to anger -"\n\nAll at once [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] was animated, almost snarling. Alexei reeled at the sight. "And there it is! How dare you comport yourself like a union man while you bow and scrape before your employers! What a travesty to the spirit of Unionism, and an insult to the ideals of our Nation!" Was it just him, or was there a gleam of triumph in the President's eyes? Was this sport to him?\n\nAs the men gathered around him clapped and jeered, Alexei covered his face with his hands. He'd lost the union's heart, and who knew if his successor would resist crumbling before the demands of the people? Or if the Company wouldn't expel them from the factory altogether?

Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Komi Republic Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were. I wish to hear a little more about why [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] chose you - for our common will must be built through our understanding of our individual purposes. What can we bring to democracy - and how can we bring it about?"\n\nThe men looked to him, then around them, and they began to laugh. One slapped the table, chuckling as he got the words out. "Oh, Korolkov, you're funny. You're right. Let's admit it, folks -" The man gestured expansively to a nodding audience. "We were picked because we stand to gain from it all. We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile.

The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat.

Waiting for the sobs, like hiccoughs in a child, to die down, Ivanov murmured: "We are terribly sorry for your losses, Madam Lykova. The last few years have been harsh on us all. But my heart bleeds for you and your son."\n\nThe mention of her son seemed to sweep Lykova into a fresh wave of sadness. "My son - my son - how will he be employed with his hand? How, I ask you? And with the latest layoffs-"\n\n"Yes, caught in the organ-grinder at a machine-shop. I'm told that the shop has shut down for lack of money, so if it eases your heart, Madam, the men whose neglect hurt your son are no longer at large to do so."\n\nAs the Madam sniffed, Ivanov gestured frantically to the audio-crew. Time to wrap this up in a nice little closing segment, and they could begin the work of clearing the woman's voluminous tears out of her seat and the table. Goodness, this would certainly leave a stain.\n\n"As the latest Budget of the Republic suggests continued economic downturn for the next three fiscal quarters, women like Lykova find their worries only growing. Hard-earned savings are drying up. Businesses shutter, their revenues fleeing to the four winds. And as Komi's workers struggle, the question is not whether the Government will act to rebuild the economy."\n\nIvanov paused for dramatic effect. "The question is whether the Government will do it by itself, or if the working-men of Russia must force their hand. Thank you for joining us today - this has been Sergey Ivanov, reporting from Radio Free Russia. And now for a word from our sponsors...""

The party has been split in two by this issue, and if we do not step in, it could divide the party even further and destabilize our democracy.\n\nAdopted by party members many years ago, the policy espoused by the PSD, or rather a collection of policies, are very critical of Russia's past actions - especially those of the empire. Those who support the policy, primarily those who helped create it, say the policy is necessary to encourage positive change and improvements in Russia, as we should not forget those who failed before us. However, some say it is so anti-Russian that it must be abolished. Those who critique it say it goes against the ideals of a strong, united Russia, and if advocated for by the PSD, it will only weaken the party and the republic in the long run.\n\nTo maintain the unity of the party, action must be taken.

Nadia sighed, threw up her hands in defeat, and finally departed the little cabin, an hour after her friends had already left. All except Pavel, as it turned out, who smiled at her from a chair on the porch, causing instant guilt and embarrassment to come bubbling to the surface.\n\n"You have a strange taste in friends", he spouted with scathing sarcasm. She shot him a glare, and as he stood up, a punch on the shoulder. She hated to admit it, but the statement held some truth. What was she doing hanging around an old soldier all day? Her friends had come for the booze and the tall tales, two things Vadim had in spades. He was an entertaining spectacle to be sure, but for the rest of the young people in Sykvytar, nothing more.\n\n"I just think that old fool needs some help is all. It isn't healthy to spend all your time drunk, weaving words and reminiscing alone. Besides, there's a good heart buried in there somewhere" Pavel responded knowingly.\n\n"Well, if you want to spend all your time around old kooks with Soviet flags on their porch, I won't stop you..."\n\nShe knew he was right, on some level. Who was she to tell some old man what to do? Still, each week she would find herself lingering in Vadim's residence, shooting the shit in lengthy kitchen discussions. There was something tender about the old man, and as the months went by, mild curiosity became a genuine friendship. Vadim had become Nadia's pet project, and she encouraged him to come into town. Like a turtle, coaxed from its shell, her efforts had begun to yield fruit."

Vadim, usually a belligerent complainer, had noticed her change in attitude. He was calm, caring, and for once, her confidant. She had sat crying on his furniture, feeling better after a long talk.\n\nToday, as she approached the small cottage from a distance, a pit formed in her stomach. Vadim's flag was down, and his front door wide open. Two cars flanked each wall, and an armed militant leaned against one.\n\n"Whats going on?" She called out nervously\n\n"Possession of Symbols of antidemocratic regimes is a crime" the militant retorted matter of factly "what do you care?"\n\nNadia felt sick. If there was anyone in Syvkvytar who would resist such a measure, it would be Vadim. Though he could hardly make his way across the house sometimes, she held no doubt's that the tough old bastard would throw punches before taking down his flag voluntarily. The thought of Vadim, a bloodied and languishing in some brutal prison, was almost too much to bear.\n\nShe set off in a panic, afraid of what she would find when she arrived."

A political landmine had found its way to her desk, shoving a wrench in her proceeding with more important matters.\n\nOn the "Left" were those that supported autonomy. Russia, they rightly argued, was neither wholly European or Asian. Beneath her shattered banner lived many races; Buryats, Kazakhs, Tartars, Bashkirs. Each had unique customs, and a distinct identity. Trying to force them all into some unitary "Russian" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image. To live in Russia was to be Russian, insignificant cultures be damned. Besides, what would matter most to the Baskirs and Tartars, bread and electricity? Or some pseudo-autonomy?"

Many centuries ago, Russia was much smaller than it was before the Great Patriotic War and the Russian Revolution. Siberia remained much of a wasteland, with few people living there. To expand the glory of the empire and spread Russian culture, the Tsars decided to settle more Russians east of the Urals. Nowadays, many Russians live in Siberia, and it is no different from Russia the further West you go. Expanding into Siberia made Russia big and strong. No one wants to be in a tiny country, do they?" The teacher paused and looked around the classroom, finding a boy with his hand up.\n\n"Teacher, what happened to the people in Siberia before we went there? Did they go somewhere else?" The boy questioned.\n\nThe teacher paused a moment, thinking. "Well, as I said, there were some people in Siberia before us. Not much changed for them though, they are still there, even in Siberia today. Back then though, many were ruled by terrible khans and suffered under raiders until Russia united them and brought them into Russia. With Russian culture, they learned to work together with each other and the new Russians." Content with her explanation, the teacher began to change the subject, then the boy spoke up once again.\n\n"Didn't they fight back though, like we fought the Germans?"\n\n"What, that's nothing like what happened at all," replied the teacher, obviously vexed by the boy. "Those are two entirely different situations. The raiders fought us of course, but they were murdering poor and innocent Russians. They had to be fought. Meanwhile, the Germans planned to exterminate all of Russia! The Germans were brutish devils while the Russians were pure saviors. Now, I don't want to hear about this any longer. We are going to talk about the war with the Polish Commonwealth to liberate the Slavic peoples there. Open your books to page 402, please.""

When she had thought of working to unite Russia, working to a better tomorrow for democracy, she hadn't imagined fools throwing themselves around at irrelevant issues instead of looking at the bigger picture. The biggest points of contention lately had not been of military strategy or anything that actually had any meaning. No, the bureaucrats were battling over the "Redemption of Russia". She needed to cement the state position, otherwise the Republic would still be babbling on about culture in the year 2000. Looking over suggestions for opening her speech gave her a headache. One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards "Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to "The most loyal Russians of the Empire". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the "critique" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem "Imperialistic". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted "as a man".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket. For this speech, she already knew the general ideas of what both sides of the party wanted. The Left, pandering to progressive causes and pluralism. The Right, lip service to a strong Russia. She weighed her options. She had little care for the actual issue, but the Right were presently a more powerful ally. It would anger the Leftists, sure, but, perhaps, that didn't quite matter all that much anyways. As long as Russia could be united under the Free Republic, it didn't matter who she stiffed.

The streets were littered with the chaos of the recent days, red and gold-black banners mingled with the usual unpicked garbage, and navigating through them was almost an adventure in itself. Trying to ignore the acrid stench of cordite, she marched on, eyes almost closed - and it was then that she ran into the barricade. Curious. The street had been open the week before. And these soldiers didn't look like members of the People's Battalions, either: they wore the colors of the Republic on their armbands.\n\nAlmost on instinct she drifted towards the soldiers. If they had an extra toll for visitors, it would do no harm to find out early, wouldn't it? A soldier with an epaulette on his shoulder - an officer, perhaps, nodded to her. "Good day, madam. What can we do for you?"\n\n"If there's a toll we need to pay to cross this street, how much is it going to be? The last People's Battalion charged a ruble." Her voice sounded almost childish, talking about these things. "Isn't there a market rate for this sort of thing?" The soldiers looked at each other and chuckled. One of them threw Galina something - in her surprise she barely caught it. A military ration-biscuit. Official.\n\n"We ain't from no irregular unit, lady. This here is all Government-sanctioned." The officer smiled, his face barely twitching above the lips. "There's a new Government in town, and from here on out there won't be toll-booths for streets ever again. Not if we can help it."\n\nAs they waved farewells behind her Galina stumbled on her way.

Boss Matovsky seldom came in before 11, the workers filed in at 9 sharp and between these times a peace descended upon the little cubicles of the Tax Registry Bureau. She would take her custom-made cup (a gift from a friend) and swish the dregs of her tea as she paced the office, taking in the sheer freshness of the morning streaming in through the office windows. There was something about solitude, Ludmila felt, that made the everyday magical - it was the redeeming perk of an otherwise uneventful job.\n\nShe wondered, as she often did, what the men and women of the office did to make them stay so late. Most offices closed at 5 and opened at 8, but she'd been specified to leave the offices open till 2am. If her parents hadn't passed on a few years back she'd have refused the job outright for its late hours. Even so, she was a light sleeper.\n\nAnd sometimes files passed, here and there, without even Ludmila noticing, and some of the dossiers she managed were thick one day and thin the next. It wasn't her job to notice, and so she made an effort not to. Better to keep to silence than to risk an intrusion - or her salary.\n\nThis morning, she thought, she would make herself her favourite tea-brew. Humming a light tune, she walked to the office doors and was taken quite by surprise by the thud of gunfire.\n\nAs the noise hammered her ears, she huddled by instinct against her desk and watched her world torn asunder by burly soldiers hefting crate upon crate of files - and protesting men - out the door. An officer, clambering up to her, yelled at her to go home - and four words, repeated over and over, such that they rang in her head with every step of the journey."

Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world.

The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window.

It was time to bite the bullet. "I assure you, this period is temporary. In my years of work, have you ever seen me hesitate in my struggle to build democracy? I will not abandon my long work for the sake of petty power." She gestured at the Assembly. "Tell your friends, scream it at your enemies. We will restore you sooner than you think."\n\nMorozov looked unsatisfied, but nodded. For the both of them, this would have to suffice until some better alternative emerged."

Stalina knew she was losing control - reading crowds was intuitive to her - and for the first time in quite awhile she struggled to compose a response.\n\nPresently a group of middle aged bureaucrats padded up to her, led by old Morozov, long-time associate even if they had never really agreed on much. Morozov cast a quizzical look at her, unsmiling, calculative as ever. "We need to talk about the role that the Assembly plays in, well, governing this country. As you can see, we are one-track horses: when the racetrack is denied us, we whinny in our stables until we are set loose."\n\nStalina nodded slowly. These people were worse than horses, she thought: horses could be ridden, while people were never so trustworthy as to carry out even that simple task. How many times had she been sidelined by the allies she had trusted? How many times had simple mandates gotten bogged down in the realpolitik she was forced to endure?\n\nShe had made the mistake of betting on horses once before. It was time to learn from history. Rising to leave, she said loudly, so Morozov's men could all hear it: "The stable gates will stay locked, then, until these horses learn obedience.

Stalina kneaded her eyes, clutched at a useless coffee mug, and gazed at the dense script. Something in her felt deeply unbalanced, like a child playing on an endless swing whose hinges grew ever looser. Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the Unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees. Surely this would be enough.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet...Stalina's head whirled, a maelstrom of thought. It was far too much, it was never enough. How had it ever come to this?

Here and there a busker played their repertoire to all who would listen, drawing in curious crowds and the occasional tourist. If there were signs of protest, they were certainly well hidden (although the recent Public Security Act was very comprehensive, it was not supernatural).\n\nShe felt tired, hollowed out, even. The preceding months had taken their toll on her sleep schedule, and she'd been through so many arguments with her closest staff that she sometimes felt ashamed to greet them in the morning. It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day.

It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. "No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances." She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. "President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week."\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him.

And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic.

And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him.

He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. "Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though." And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work!

But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do.

The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit.

Scattered reports have surfaced of a female bearing a strong resemblance to the subject being sighted near Storozhevsk, though follow-up work by police has been without result.\n\nAnalysis:\nStalina is not to be underestimated, and is a savvy political operator who is likely working to build a united front among liberal opposition groups. She is almost certainly accompanied by some of her loyal associates, in particular former Gen. Petro Grigorenko (PDZ-339), in conjunction with whom she poses a serious insurgent threat to our government. Her liquidation should be undertaken at the earliest opportunity possible."

His liquidation has the potential to cut off insurgent supply lines and significantly decrease such groups' efficacy."

It is very likely that he possesses a senior leadership role among leftist resistance elements, and his liquidation must be considered an extremely high priority for our administration. Although Suslov himself possesses no military training, he is an extremely shrewd political operator, and poses a continued risk to our government as long as he remains alive and out of our hands."

Sources close to leftist resistance cells claim that Zhdanov is in hiding in an isolated village somewhere in the remote northern regions of Komi, though his exact location is reportedly being restricted only to the most trusted party cadres.

Penetrating his inner circle in the past has been quite difficult due to the highly-indoctrinated and even fanatical nature of many of his closest associates, and it stands to reason that his present circumstances may only exacerbate this tendency.

Although Bukharina is undoubtedly an effective political force in her own right, her symbolic value is arguably far more threatening, and she could serve as an effective rallying point for Bukharinist holdouts.

As the voice and ideological father of the movement, and a highly influential figure among right-wing circles more broadly, Gumilyov is arguably one of the most capable organizers of opposition against our government.

His military experience, along with his training in counterintelligence and deception, likely makes him a highly elusive and resourceful foe who will require significant resource investment to track down.

Search parties in the area have found multiple corpses; initially, these were believed to be followers who had died of exposure to the elements. However, the discovery of ligature marks and signs of torture (at least one corpse was found nailed to a tree) suggests that these individuals were killed deliberately, possibly by the subject and his remaining supporters, though the motives for this remain unclear.

For the past day, Kosygin was alone, his mind aching at the thought of what was going back home - yet he couldn't dare turn back. He knew what had happened, how Komi fell into chaos. Every hour, every minute, he cursed himself for not taking enough action. He knew the eventual fate of Komi, yet kept himself silent. Now he had paid the ultimate price, and the only thing that came his way was downfall. He hadn't even learned about the fate of Svetlana Stalina, a fact that haunted him every step of the way. There were the fates of many to worry about, but he shared with her a sort of grim opinion of Komi's democracy that, unfortunately, turned out to be true.\n\nNow, guided by the strobes of moonlight his escape from the compromised nation came into fruition. In the thick forests, there were no guards, no tachankas, nothing that could stop him. Only the blowing wind and the idle sounds of forest life. Even then, his nerves were on-guard, and Kosygin felt that this trip through the forest would be the makings of a new source of paranoia - but he had to brave the sheer emptiness of it all, the lack of human life, and pray that he would not suddenly receive a bullet to the back.\n\nAt the crack of next dawn, Kosygin found himself on the other side. He wasn't sure what sort of freedom he would find, and he didn't know if it would truly be a better fate than death at the hands of the radicals. But he had already made his choice long ago, and he would reap the rewards and suffer the consequences for it. Voznesensky's ideal was dead, and Kosygin wanted nothing further to do with it."

Out from the ashes, a phoenix burned, holding the ideals of thousands and thousands, of a stable Republic, of something that every Russian would gladly call their home.\n\nYet unlike a phoenix, Komi was burnt too badly, and the phoenix of democracy crumbled back into ashes. As Voznesensky ran into the night, death grazing his shoulder multiple times, he finally found himself at the edge of a river. From the other side, there were new pastures, and on the bottom of the river near him sat a small boat made for one person. He had arranged it for himself and only himself, in the dead of night, so that no guard could spot and open fire at a traitor of the new Komi.\n\nWhen he settled himself down and began to cross the river, he looked back. Perhaps in these new lands of Vyatka, he could make change. Perhaps, he thought, it was unnecessary to dream about what Komi had been. It was stabler in Vyatka, potentially even richer. There was a Tsar, and while that in itself didn't bode well, he knew that it was no autocracy. Elements of freedom still remained, and, unlike Komi, were not directly threatened by forces that wished to lock it all away. As Voznesensky looked back, he felt the grip on the paddles weaken, though remain firm. He didn't wish to cross, but he knew that he only had one choice.\n\nBy the time he arrived on the other side, he only wished to lay down and rest, for the horrible realization that struck his mind only kept growing and growing in his mind.

But Suslov's suspicion about something like that happening so easily led him to repeatedly asking that same question, and, as noon turned down midnight, he began actively fidgeting, pressing his thumbs to his hands and moving them up and down. That was the only sign he gave, and that was enough to send worry to the other agents in the vehicle, driver included. If he was worried, they pretended not to notice, but they, along with Suslov, knew.\n\nWhen the hour struck somewhere within the night, his tired voice asked yet again. "Have we made it?" It sounded like Suslov was to pass out soon enough, but he wouldn't dare do that. Not when his life was on the line. He waited and waited, until he received his answer.

Shame, for Andrei Zhdanov had every right to attempt to save the Republic from the decadence of capitalism and its fascist and fascist-adjacent allies. But here he was, on the run, with nothing to show. His influence within the National Assembly was now nulled, and what remained was merely the ideology that he has formed.\n\nZhdanov, however, would scoff at the notion that his ideology would not eventually be triumphant. Even as he took off into the cover of night, keeping his identification card in his back pocket and driving through the dark streets of Komi towards the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he was stopped by two guards on the border. "Name and identification, please." One of them ordered, and Zhdanov was more than happy to comply. "I am Andrei Zhdanov," he began, passionate yet worried at the same time. "A political refugee from Komi. The nation has fallen into chaos!" He exclaimed, and the guards eyed him warily.\n\n"Chaos?" One of them asked, returning Zhdanov's identification card to him. "Yes!"

Now Russia would never again be the center of the world as it was always destined to be. In Vyatka there was a Tsar, unfocused and unguided, a fact that did little to alleviate his anger, as it was only marginally better than the betrayal he found in Komi.

And they would not, either. Too far did they fall from Taboritsky's gaze.

Ever since Komi's government toppled in favor of the new order, he had been sent into a run. Now he was far away from civilization, wandering between Russia's trees and the crickets of night life that made him jump in his skin. He knew, damned as he was, knew that Komi would capitulate itself to the chaos Voznesensky refused to deal with. But it was too late now, and he paid for it in form of exile.\n\nKeeping himself steady, he moved deeper into the forest. By the time the sun shone down on him, he would be out of Komi territory and into safety. That was the hope. The truth was that such hopes would be dashed into the ground. It came in the form of a gunshot; crackling and powerful from his left side, Kosygin's heart dropped and his arms went cold. He wasn't hit, but perhaps it was worse because of it, as his legs thumped and feet began pounding against the dirt and mud and leaves that all fell around him. He was already tired before, now he brinked on exhaustion.\n\nHe barely kept his eyes forward as he ran, only enough to see what trees to dodge and what foliage to jump over, while his mind whirred with chaos and fear. Was this the end? All it would take was one shot. Kosygin grit his teeth and fired blindly to his side, quickly emptying the magazine of his pistol. Every shot missed, he knew, but as if penance struck him, he felt one of his legs go numb, and Kosygin fell, his head slamming against the hard ground.\n\nWith a pounding headache, a throbbing heart, and a tremoring body, Kosygin's lips formed the words for mercy. He was in too much pain to see, let alone speak properly, but still his voice croaked for relief, begging to be spared."

To the more amicable members of the National Assembly, he did not know their fates. Nor did he want to. Anywhere from freedom to painful death awaited them. To his enemies he cursed their names, but nothing more. They, he figured, would be left behind him.\n\nThere was a river that separated the nation of Komi from the Tsarists in Vyatka, and he figured it his best option of escaping. So he convinced the local fisherman to lend him a boat. Just a simple crossing, he said, then it would be returned to him. That night, as he carefully walked through the grass and to the border separating him from life and death, Voznesensky felt like something was off. Something was different in the air that night than the one before it- but he had no time to think on it.\n\nInstead, he got on the boat, and began to paddle to the other side. It brought him some peace of it, the simplicity of it. A simplicity that he, unfortunately, could not take in for long.\n\nGunfire ripped holes into his body from behind, as they pierced the wooden structure of the boat. Voznesensky felt shock, pain, and terror - then he felt nothing, as his body wobbled, then collapsed into the azure blue river that began to be stained with the blood of an architect."

The other two would sit in the back of the van and serve as muscle and firepower. Suslov would be hanging back as well, sufficiently armed for an extended firefight. As they got into the vehicle, he could feel the air tighten. Again, Suslov felt that something was wrong, but he made no emotion present. Merely warning his guards to keep their eyes and ears out - especially the driver. The goal was simple. Get to Vologda.\n\nYet only ten minutes after starting their journey, Suslov's suspicions were proven right. Bullets pierced the door to the back of the van, and he ducked his head down, grabbing tightly his rifle as one bodyguard rushed to the front. The driver kept his eyes on the road and began swerving left and right, and Suslov and his other bodyguard kicked open the back doors in tandem, revealing something they had to pay attention to immediately.\n\nTwo open-topped cars trailed past them, both armed with gunmen, both making holes in the van. Suslov immediately got on the floor, bringing up the iron sights and opening fire as his bodyguard was not so lucky, crying out in pain and collapsing in a huddled mess. The exchange went on for a few seconds more before Suslov heard his bodyguard at the front begin to open fire as well, and he could see the vehicle in front of him begin drifting sideways, the driver slumped back as it eventually slammed into the off-road.\n\nBut Suslov was not a lucky man. Even though he felt secure in victory, fear began to finally grip his heart when he heard flesh rip behind him. Letting go of his gun, Suslov began running to the driver's seat. The van bumped wildly against the road, and as he began forcing the dead man off the wheel, he felt the vehicle flip."

komi_friendship.1.d:0 "The National Assembly of the Komi Republic is a place of intrigue, deception, and thinly-veiled threats disguised as compromises. Despite it being a well-functioning heart of the Republic's body, it was filled to the brim with different shades of plaque clashing within. Among the zealous left and populist right laid the ruling Center coalition. The DSNP, SMR, and PSD were the three truly democratic parties in the Assembly. While they could not be more different in terms of their policy, all of them sat together and all of them hated the extremist wolves eyeing their seats hungrily from the shadows.\n\nOn the border between SMR and PSD seats sat two assembly members, looking a bit more alert than usual at the new selection of bills being brought up on the floor. From the SMR, there was a tall yet dainty looking woman; perhaps a bit older than she'd look. From the PSD, a stocky, brash, well-built young man sat next to her. They both thought similar things about the debate happening, listening intently for anything intolerable. As much as they hated the extremists, they loved the Republic, and loved her democracy.\n\nAfter a member of the Passionariyy went on an agitated, boisterous rant which disturbed half the assembly, the two eyed each other. "People like him would destroy our democracy", they both said in their glances, exchanging expressions. With a small, mutual nod, they introduced themselves to each other..."

They happened to agree on some aspects of policy together, despite having vast differences. Both of them held distaste for the far-left and far-right, and both of them were elected under similar circumstances, under similar stakes. They were becoming fast friends, despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle.\n\n"So, Yevgeny. Do you really think Miss Stalina's economic recovery plan is that different from Voznesensky's?"\n\n"Voznesensky is a left-wing populist who would let Zhdanov and his goons walk over him and influence his economic policy. Stalina would never let radical leftism taint her economic policy!"\n\nBoth of them gave a small chuckle, and continued debating. They all knew it wasn't serious, and it was more to gauge their individual abilities and comfort with each other. They did sit in the same caucus after all; it wouldn't hurt to know the ideals of your ally. As the assembly began to clear out for a break, the two remained behind, still sitting together and growing ever quieter.\n\n"Hey, Elena? Why are you working with me? Doesn't Kosygin see Stalina and my party as borderline despotic?"\n\n"Well..." she said, after a pause..."

After the news of Voznesensky deciding to sideline Kosygin's coalition, many assemblymen and women walked out of the building in protest and would only return for important policy decisions. But not Elena. Despite her being rather furious, she stood her ground with very few other SMR members, those who would hopefully make their voices heard.\n\n"That disgusting, apathetic, traitorous pig! Is Voznesensky abandoning the party that won the last election with him for those dirtbag Marxist-Leninist zealots?"\n\nYegveny sighed, understanding her concern. "I get that, I really do. I'm sure he would've done the same to us if we were in the SMR's place, but our caucus has bigger things to focus on right now. Almost the entire SMR delegation walking out shows the others that we do not stand in solidarity with each other, and it makes us look weak."\n\nElena, now looking physically furious, began to full-on debate Yevgeny. "How could you even support anything that conniving despot says? He would throw the entire caucus under the bus to drink champagne with his party and celebrate victory while working with the very forces which want to destroy us! Let me guess, your 'Woman of Steel' said it wasn't a big deal. That she would work with whatever the DSNP wants to keep her own party in the majority. We're supposed to stay true to our democratic principles!"\n\nThe rest of the Assembly looked on in intrigue, and Elena soon became part of the procession who left the building. Yevgeny sat there, somewhat upset and embarrassed, but silently believed that she would come to her senses. She, and the rest of the SMR, had to. For if they didn't, our democracy would die."

Cheers, handshakes, and applause roared throughout the assembly; Elena and Yevgeny included.\n\n"I'm not too partial on Kosygin's approach to reconciliation with the radicals and military policy."\n\n"And I'm not too happy about Stalina dodging questions about gerrymandering, but we're still here, no?"\n\nYevgeny nodded, and a smile formed on both of their faces. Their friendly debates and mutual agreements finally came in handy today. When discussing law and order policies, Elena's defense of PSD's actions managed to keep many from the SMR from walking out in protest. A mutual consensus was seemingly agreed on, one without any spoken word or initiative. The consensus of peace, the consensus of stability, and the consensus of holding true to what made our Republic special. We would never stoop to the level of the Tsar or the Marshal, we would always look to the people and the President.\n\nEven if compromises had to be made, our coalition and system would survive."

"They'd refuse to work with you, and potentially the rest of the SMR. Maybe they'd witch hunt out anyone like you. It would all be for naught..."\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door, and a distant Yevgeny approaching her with some papers. In a panic, she knocked her diary to the floor, but accidentally spilled her tea along with it.\n\n"Goodness, are you okay?" Yevgeny said, walking toward her with caution.\n\n"No, Yevgeny. No I'm not."\n\nYevgeny helped Elena clean up, and then sat down with her. She spoke softly, and quietly, and said something which made his eyebrows raise.\n\n"I was... A follower of them before. I was an ardent socialist once. To think that if nutjobs like Zhdanov weren't in the party, I would've stayed. I'm just scared that someone will find out now that we're taking the fight to them."\n\nYevgeny, standing up, put his hand on Elena's shoulder supportively and smiled. "That's in the past now, no? We're fighting them now, and that's what matters. Who better to beat them than a former supporter?" She smiled, politely nodded, and thanked him.

Among other initiatives to strengthen the power of the Center came Elena and Yevgeny, as they were a few months ago, analyzing key issues together. Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n"The left is divided between 'reformist' and 'orthodox' lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus." Elena presented.\n\n"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well." Yevgeny added. "We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face."\n\n"Like what? What's an obstacle which could possibly be holding us back?" Elena eyed Yevgeny, and the two nodded at each other. They were ready for this. They've seen and known it since day one.

Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise." Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n"Hey, Yevgeny!" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. "I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. "Elena, I have to come clean. I was a card-carrying member of them once. The Passionariyy. To think I only spent some years off the street beating our political opponents... I don't want to be reminded of it, and I'm terrified of what they'd do to me if they found out."\n\nElena sighed, and sat down on his desk, with her arm extended to move his face to look at her. "Yevgeny, it's okay. I don't care what you did back then. You're a good person now, and you're going to help us put a nail in their coffin for good.

komi_friendship.8.d:0 "After much debate in another closed meeting of the Assembly, many agreed that Stalina was the best shot at curbing radical leftist influence. A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic..."\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. "I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Kosygin was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts. Especially not me."\n\nWith a sigh, she nodded. "I'll consider supporting her agenda in the future. I suppose I owe you for this one, friend.""

Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. "I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors." With his statement, the Center remained quiet.

There would be a future for the people of Komi which wasn't one which would bend too far to either side.\n\n"So..." She began.

I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose."\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. "Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too." Elena nodded.\n\n"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through.

Whoever this person was, they were becoming a clearer and more present threat to the now weakened right and fragile center.\n\n"We believe we may have a lead on who this figure is." The room goes silent, as another assemblyman passes around a dossier to the members of the meeting. "Bukharin's daughter. While heaven knows if her old man is still alive, the name alone carries intense weight for all of us; especially the voters."\n\nElena turns to Yevgeny, and she begins to whisper. "Stalina. Not yours, though. I've heard rumors of her. Didn't even think she was a real person..."\n\n"She's one of those populist types. If she comes around and charms over some of the left's voter base, a good fight will be had."\n\nWith a strict ahem from the orating assemblyman, the two quiet down and listen.

Deputy Kosygin would be a safe, sane choice for a healthy democratic Komi, and perhaps with time, Russia as a whole. In a region and world so corrupted by undemocratic tyrants, the policies of Deputy Kosygin would be the light shining against the darkness."\n\n"...I speak for many of us when I say that Stalina is a bulwark. She will protect your rights, your freedoms, and this country from radicals. No other candidate is as crucial to ensuring a safe and just democratic process as she is. I promise she will never let you, nor the people of Komi, down!"\n\nBoth finished their speeches to respective cheers and boos. As they both sat down in their seats, they gave each other the same look they once did a year ago. Whatever the result would be, they were in this together, and spoke their minds as anyone should."

He thought of him as a misguided idealogue.\n\n"Now what?" Elena sighed, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. "Neither of us want to stand up for that racist bastard, but do we have another choice?"\n\n"I didn't come this far over a year to quit now. You don't care about how we got here, and neither do I. But this is the hand we've been dealt. There's too much at stake to not play it."\n\n"I... Suppose you're right. It's just disappointing to have it come down to this."\n\nThe two walked briskly in silence. Yevgeny's hands were sternly clasped in his pockets, gripping an anger that wasn't entirely there.

Elena tried to console her colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on him. Much like the Woman of Steel herself, Yegveny was seemingly dead-set on his iron-willed ideals.\n\nThat is, until he stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep inhale, he released the tension in his body, and turned to face Elena. "It's no big deal. I know we were upset during the nomination, but I want to talk to some of them. Tell them that there's still hope. We may not be the happiest, but we're willing to hold on much the same. Even with Kosygin."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, he crosses the busy street.

With the clink of two glasses, both assembly members take the first few sips of their drinks. Yevgeny coughs a bit, but with a cheerful expression. Elena simply sits calmly and downs her liquor, the bitterness trapping her tongue. Vodka, above all else, was more than just cheap entertainment and a staple of the Anarchic diet. It was a truth-sealer. "I didn't think we'd get this far without being shot, honestly."\n\n"Oh, nonsense! If you keep thinking like that, Elena, I'd be surprised if you don't drop dead from this vodka." Holding in their laughter, the two finally break and chuckle childishly. Perhaps in the past year, they would never expose this laid-back attitude to one another. Political enemies. PSD dog. SMR freeloader. All of that distrust and hatred disappeared with a few sips.\n\nAfter sitting silently for a while and drinking a bit more, Yevgeny pushes his drink to the side and faces his friend. "Hey, Elena? Promise me something over one more drink, eh?"\n\n"What's the matter? About to tell me your life story?"\n\n"Nah, this is way better. You and me, no matter what happens tomorrow... I want us to stick together. We came this far to protect our democracy. I don't want to jeer at your side of the aisle again."\n\nAlthough originally taken off guard, she nods intently and offers her hand. "Shake on it. For life."

It's a miracle you woke up today." Elena retorts. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and much work to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every heated debate led to this tranquility. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands. As they begin to head home, they only wish for a better tomorrow, one with the wounds of the past long gone."

komi_friendship.19.t:0 "Our Extremely Fragile Democracy"
komi_friendship.19.d:0 "Syktyvkar was burning. It seems that the efforts to ensure that the Center would win the election were not as strong as once believed. Violence by extremists was reported six hours ago. Two hours ago, the first molotov was thrown. Now, the city streets of Syktyvkar became an all-out warzone, with different factions determined to wrestle control over the facilities of government. It seems that the worst case scenario has become reality; and now it was a time of survival.\n\nElena and Yevgeny were shocked, initially. How could all of their efforts have failed? Was the Center not united enough? Perhaps the extremists gained too much strength? Whatever the case was, both of them have been drafted to serve under an emergency government under [NIK.GetLeader]. Their goal was no longer to save democracy, but save Komi entirely from the ever-encroaching threat of radical takeover.\n\n"Yevgeny." Elena said, shakily gripping her hastily-issued pistol in its holster. "Is this a bad dream?"\n\nHis expression did not give her any condolences. Perhaps, behind his usual carefree and steely demeanor, he was terrified too. "The only way to wake up is to work together now. This time, for real. I know we can do it."\n\nPlacing a comforting hand on her shoulder, the two pass by some soldiers and walk into an emergency command room, ready to take action once more."

komi_friendship.20.d:0 "They woke up with bags around their head, and their hands tied with rope. All they felt was the tight grasp of somebody escorting them, and then forcing them to their knees. Elena and Yevgeny breathed heavily, as other people were forced to sit around them. The crackle of flames were present around them. What exactly happened? Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. "Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?"\n\n"Not Guilty!" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--"\n\n"GUILTY! Let them hang alongside their collaborationist brethren."\n\nDespite their cries, despite their physical resistance, this was the end. Elena and Yevgeny, with the strike of a gavel, now had their necks wrought around a noose. They had failed. Despite all of their promises, their work would be for naught with the simple collapse of a platform. Tears escaped Yevgeny's eyes. Elena remained silent. Both of them composed themselves, with a final exhale, before their lives were taken from them as swiftly as the floor below them dropped."

komi_friendship.21.t:0 "Refuge"
komi_friendship.21.d:0 ""I'm sorry."\n\nThose were the only words which escaped Elena's mouth. The defense was failing. Around them, their safehouse was burning. Their last, desperate attempt at freedom has gone awry. Rightist paramilitary groups were winning against the final garrison defending the would-be refugees. The hallways were filled with gunfire, screams, the crackling of wood. All that they loved, all that they fought for, was finally being eviscerated in front of their very eyes. Good men died to prevent this. Worse men fought to reduce it to ash.\n\nYevgeny coughed heavily, a stray bullet still lodged in his lung. The clenched hand grasping at his gunshot wound was becoming weaker by the second. He didn't believe that he would die here. Not in some run-down records room, slumped over against a table with one of his former enemies at his side. The pistol on the ground was empty, much like the air in his body. Perhaps, if there were still some bullets left, they could fight. One last, desperate clawing attempt for liberation. Perhaps they could end their life. Surely, whatever the fascists did to them would be worse than death.\n\n"We promised... And we failed."\n\nAs Yevgeny became closer to death, the door to the record room was slammed open with a kick. A member of the fascist paramilitary, with the raise of his PPSh, filled the duo with bullets and added to brass piles on the floor. After a quick look around the room, he looks down at the victims. Whoever they were then didn't matter now; Russia would move on without them. With that concluding thought, the soldier exits the room and ducks his head low to avoid the smoke around him."

No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the efforts of the PSD's reconstruction government have triumphed over all opposing forces.

As the two began to walk home, Elena turned back to Yevgeny, but his eyes stayed the course forward. Despite their victory, she felt like something was lost. Something ate at her from the inside, a feeling which did not go away through her steps echoing off the pavement below her..."
