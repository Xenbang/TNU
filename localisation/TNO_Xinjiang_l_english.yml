 POLITICS_ZHANG_ZHIZHONG_DESC:0 "Zhang Zhizhong is a man with too many problems.\n\nHis future seemed bright at first. He was born south in Anhui, in the growing city of Chaohu. His upbringing was mirrored with the fall of the Qing, and in 1916 got a spot in Baoding Military Academy, the military academy where so many of the great republican leaders set their fate in leading armies against the enemies of the republic. Zhang, little more then a boy, graduated with high-marks. From there, after a short stint in Shanghai, he went on to Yunnan and Guangxi to join up with local warlords in the region, learning to fight in the mountains and hills of the region, before serving under the great father of modern China, Sun Yat-Sen, instructing at Sun's military school, Whampoa Academy. Zhang Zhizong was a rising star and friend of Sun Yat-Sen, and it showed.\n\nAfter serving in the most important campaigns of the Guomindong, Zhang joined the disgraced general Chiang Kai-Shek, eventually taking the role of the Governor of Hunan in 1938. It was this unfortunate arrangement that was to signal the beginning of Zhang's troubles. In order to keep the wealth of the ancient city of Changsha away from the Japanese, Zhang resolved to burn the city down. Burn it he did, killing 30,000 and destroying the city entirely as the fire got out of hand.\n\nExpectedly, Chiang's embarrassed regime relieved Zhang and his subordinates of their duties, and Zhang took on a new military role. With the Japanese encroaching further, however, he fled west, to Xinjiang. With a hungry army on his hands, Zhang took Xinjiang from the local warlords and centralized the nation, working closely with the newly created pro-Japanese RGOC.\n\nHowever, Zhang Zhizhong's rehabilitation and leadership of Xinjiang is plagued with problems. The nationalistic Uighurs look on from Kashgar, while internal militants wage a never-ending guerilla war. Zhang's resettlement of Hans from the east has failed spectacularly, and now vast Han homesteads are burned down by horsemen looking to get their land back. The black market has boomed despite Zhang's attempt to reform the economy.\n\nEvery night, Zhang drinks a few glasses of sake and sits, worried, at his desk. There is no way this will turn out well for him."
