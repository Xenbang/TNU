 POLITICS_AHMED_SEKOU_TOURE_DESC:0 "Among the chaos and violence that engulfed Africa, there are a few spots of hope, shining like embers in the dark - and for many, Guinea and its president, Ahmed Sékou Touré, is one of them. Born in a Muslim family of the Mandinka aristocracy, and descending from the ancient rulers of the Wassoulou Empire, Touré received a Quranic education before becoming a postal clerk and rapidly getting involved in unions as an organizer and leader, showing clear sympathies for socialism. As the French rule over Africa slowly collapsed, all too often replaced by local warlords filling the power vacuum, Touré became more and more involved in Guinean politics, becoming the leader of the Democratic Party of Guinean and leading the fight for rule of law against the looming shadow of warlordism.\n\nIt wasn't long before Touré, thanks to his charisma and political talent, managed to become the president of the new Republic of Guinea, and one of the chief representatives of the African struggle for democracy and freedom. At least, that's what Guinean propaganda says - as always, truth is a bit more complex. In order to secure his hold over the country, Touré had to compromise on many of the ideals that he ostensibly cherishes - offering ludicrous benefits to the military to stave off the menace of warlordism while harshly repressing opposition to his rule.\n\nTouré's heavily dirigist economic policies, revolving around extensive economic planning and state-funded industrial expansion, have brought on mixed results, and Guinea's economy is still struggling. Despite this, and his many other shortcomings, Touré is still exceedingly popular in Guinea and beyond, and many still regard Guinea as one of the few democracies of Africa - but only time will tell if the Father of Guinea will succeed in his plans to make his homeland a true beacon of freedom and prosperity for the African peoples."
