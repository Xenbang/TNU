DEMOWORLDEVENT.1.t:0 "The Reich's Last Conquest"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.1.d:0 "On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner became the first man to ever land on the moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man into space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.36.t:0 "Assassin Strikes at Hitler!"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.36.d:0 "News from Germany is sporadic at best. Information smuggled out of Germania reports that shortly after celebrations over the moon landing settled, military units and several platoons worth of bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. Apparently, an assassin, which the Germans claim belonged to the Japanese Kenpeitai, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards.\n\nAlready, reports of various other assassinations have surfaced. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as several units ordered each other to stand down and the chain of command fell apart. Suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. Can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.36.a:0 "A House Divided"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.2.t:0 "Hitler Names Speer His Successor"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.2.d:0 "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Kenpeitai agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognise the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Albert Speer.\n\nA highly controversial choice, Speer enjoys the support from the left leaning members of the Reichstag and the liberal movement in Germany due to his advocacy of extensive economic and political reform. The decision has upset the more conservative elements within the Reich however, with Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich each denouncing the choice."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.3.d:0 "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Kenpeitai agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognise the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Martin Bormann.\n\nConsidered the most likely choice, the decision has been welcomed by the moderate and conservative elements of Germany, although the liberals and some elements of the military have expressed concern. With Bormann's commitment to staying the course of Nazism with only minor reform, Albert Speer, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich have criticised the choice as being certain to drive the Reich into an early grave."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.3.a:0 "More of the same it would seem."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.4.t:0 "Hitler Names Göring His Successor"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.4.d:0 "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Kenpeitai agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognise the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Hermann Göring.\n\nOne of the Führer's oldest allies and beloved uncle of the nation, Göring enjoys extensive support from the Nazi old guard and the Wehrmacht, a relationship which has caused many to reject the decision. Albert Speer, Martin Bormann and Reinhard Heydrich have all criticized the nomination, vowing to never allow the Reich to fall into the hands of a glory lusting warmonger."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.4.a:0 "Is war on the horizon?"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.5.t:0 "Hitler Names Heydrich His Successor"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.5.d:0 "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Kenpeitai agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognise the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nShock and outrage immediately consumed the Reichstag, with a quarter of the votes going against the nomination, and another quarter abstaining, the first non unanimous vote in its history. While some hail this as an end to hostilities between Germany and the SS, only few are so forgiving, with most viewing Heydrich as little more than a puppet of Burgundy as riots erupt across Germany in response."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.5.a:0 "My God."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.6.t:0 "Adolf Hitler has Died"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.6.d:0 "Tragedy has consumed Germany as the news spread first throughout the Reich and then the world. Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany and victor of the Second World War, has died. Whilst the Führer's declining health had been speculated about for some time, the news has nevertheless left Germany in a state of complete shock. The Reichstag has announced that three months of mourning shall be held, and that the Führer shall be buried beside his late wife, Eva Hitler, with dignitaries from around the world invited to the funeral.\n\nWhile Germany mourns, internationally many are celebrating the death of the man held responsible for three decades of suffering throughout the world. Yet many international commentators fear what may now become of Germany, the Third Reich having already been embattled in a bitter power struggle over the rightful successor to the Führership."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.6.a:0 "A day to remember..."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.7.t:0 "The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.7.d:0 "In the wake of Adolf Hitler's death, the Reich has erupted into chaos. Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.7.a:0 "The end of the Reich, surely."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.8.t:0 "Hans Speidel Assumes Control Of Germania"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.8.d:0 "With Germany having collapsed into civil war across the country, even at this early state of the conflict the toll both in terms of lives and destruction is rapidly becoming apparent. Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the Emergency Council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other Generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.8.a:0 "More trouble in Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.9.t:0 "Karl Dönitz Seizes Crimea"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.9.d:0 "Chaotic news is spreading out of the Black Sea amid news of a marine led coup having been launched against the local civilian administration by respected German war hero Karl Dönitz earlier this week. Serving as Commander of the major Reich naval base on Crimea, Dönitz announced via radio that following the disgraceful and illegal seizure of the Reichstag by Hans Speidel, he had no choice but to renounce the authority of Berlin.\n\nShock then erupted across the Reich, and the world, as Dönitz then openly declared for Martin Bormann. Immensely liked by the Kriegsmarine, many Captains have since declared their support for Dönitz's actions and have vowed to join him at Crimea to ensure that the Kriegsmarine remains out of the hands of those who would utterly destroy the Reich."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.9.a:0 "Troubling."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.10.t:0 "Speer Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.10.d:0 "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Albert Speer emerging as the victor. Once thought to have had too little support both from the military and the wider population to pose any real threat in the war, Speer today spoke before the Volkshalle as Germany's new Führer to vow a new era for the Reich.\n\nWhilst Speer has promised to make true on the economic and political reforms his supporters now expect to come, few suspect the next few months to be easy for the new Führer. Even should Speer be able to win over the German people and begin to heal the crippled nation, much of Europe remains consumed by a chaos many view Speer unfit to resolve. Yet with the country in ruins, many are thankful to at least have the Reich's great architect now in charge of rebuilding the nation."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.10.a:0 "Peace returns to Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.11.t:0 "Bormann Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.11.d:0 "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Martin Bormann emerging as the victor. Having enjoyed extensive support during the civil war, many expected Bormann's victory to be the most likely outcome of this terrible conflict. Standing before the Volkshalle today, the new Führer promised the German people a swift return to the former glory of the Reich, promising limited reform to ensure such a conflict never need occur again.\n\nWith the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and much of Europe still consumed by chaos however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Yet with the great politician leading them, many remain hopeful that Bormann truly will be able to return stability to the Reich.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.11.a:0 "Peace returns to Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.12.t:0 "Göring Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.12.d:0 "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Hermann Göring emerging as the victor. With much of the Heer and the Luftwaffe siding with Göring during the war proving to have been crucial to his success, the new Führer personally thanked the Wehrmacht during a speech at the Volkshalle today.\n\nWith Göring publicly advocating militaristic policies before the war, many now fear how deep the influence of the military may grow, and how long it may be before Germany finds itself in a new war. Yet with the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy and a weary populace however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Whilst many may fear for the future however, many are now simply glad Göring's military might has brought peace today.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.12.a:0 "Peace returns to Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.13.t:0 "Heydrich Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.13.d:0 "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Reinhard Heydrich emerging as the victor. Widely disliked by the German populace, it has been the might of the SS which has won Heydrich the day. Speaking before the Volkshalle, the new Führer denounced the decadancy which had corrupted Germany, and vowed to remove all hints of degeneracy from the Reich.\n\nWhilst Heinrich Himmler has offered his warmest congratulations to Heydrich, the international response has been largely muted with deep concern for the future of Germany. With the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and a Europe still consumed by chaos, many now fear what the rule of the secretive fanatical organization will have in store for the future of the Reich.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.13.a:0 "Peace returns to Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.14.t:0 "Speidel Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.14.d:0 "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with the shocking victory of Hans Speidel. Hero of the West Russian War and the man who seized Germania to protect it at the beginning of the war, Speidel refused to accept any of the contenders claims to the Führership and entered the war himself. Now victorious, Speidel bitterly condemned the contenders before the Reichstag for all the death and destruction they had inflicted upon the Reich.\n\nNow taking on the leadership of Germany himself, Speidel has vowed to enact some degree of reform to the Reich. Yet as many hail Speidel as a hero once more for saving the nation from those who tore it apart, so too do many simply denounce him as a vulture pouncing upon the carcass of Germany.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.14.a:0 "Peace returns to Germany."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.15.t:0 "Meinhof Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.15.d:0 "From the ashes of a state torn asunder, a victor has emerged in the German Civil War. The bloodiest conflict in European history, the German Civil War saw ideological giants fight, fall, and... rise. When Ulrike Meinhof and her Red Army Faction seized power from Speer's liberals, the chaos and destruction that followed on her conquest of the Reich brought devastation and a taste to the RAF's revolutionary policies for Germany. On the steps of the Reichstag, Meinhof addressed the assembled crowd with a speech decrying Nazism and the wretched institution it sustained.\n\nIt is there that the new chairwoman declared the formation of a united Deutsche Sozialistische Republik, a Marxist utopia aiming to equalize all citizens of the Reich. The future is unknown, but one can expect that the German Revolution will not be a quiet one.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.15.a:0 "Dreadful."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.16.t:0 "Schörner Wins The German Civil War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.16.d:0 "With the Reich in flames, her government crippled, and her population pressed for the never-ending conflict, what once was the European superpower has finally fallen out of total war. Ferdinand Schörner, principal supporter to Göring's militarists, has led his regiments of conscripted citizens into Germania with the intention of declaring himself Führer-regent for the reformed Reich.\n\nSpeaking to his armies from the steps of the Reichstag, Schörner declared the formal establishment of the Regierung des Nationalen Wiederaufbaus, a state aimed at rebuilding the Reich with Schörner serving as temporary head of state. With the Reich's colonial administrations having severed ties with the central authority in Germania, it is expected that Schörner's first of many "National Reconstruction" conquests will be related to the restoration of that authority.\n"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.16.a:0 "A beast has been unleashed."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.17.t:0 "The Franco-Burgundian War"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.17.d:0 "As the situation within Europe rapidly develops as the German sphere free falls into total collapse, many have wondered what if any move the secretive 'Black State' would make. With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.\n\nYet the true reasoning has now revealed itself. While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.18.t:0 "Wallace F. Bennett Elected US President"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.18.d:0 "In a surprise turn of events, the Democratic Party, thought to have been long extinguished as a major political force, has come crashing back into power. Wallace F. Bennett, of the Republican-Democrats, today won a narrow victory against the National Progressive Party to become President of the United States. Bennett utilized his acceptance speech to call on a bitterly divided America to join together as one nation to face down the struggles of the day.\n\nMild-mannered and averse to political extremes, Bennett believes that a middle ground between both sides of the civil rights debate is possible. He has also promised to expand America's diplomatic and economic outreach with fellow OFN partners and other neutral nations, breaking from the cloak-and-dagger approach of the Nixon Administration.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.19.t:0 "Lyndon B. Johnson Elected US President"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.19.d:0 "Following a close political race that for the first time saw the incumbent Republican Democrats at great risk of losing the reins of power, the party today breathed a sigh of relief as Republican nominee Lyndon B. Johnson achieved victory in the Presidential election. In his victory speech, Johnson praised the continuing endurance of his party, and vowed to carry on the good work of his predecessors.\n\nBullish but progressively-minded, Johnson shares the conviction of former President Kennedy towards the cause of civil rights. Insider voices claim he has some sort of grand project in the works, aimed at improving numerous areas of American society, but Johnson remains tight-lipped for the time being. Some political rivals have called him a stubborn bully, though many within the Center-NPP have quietly praised some of his electoral platform.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.20.d:0 "For the first time in nearly a century, neither a Democrat nor a Republican will hold the White House. Robert F. Kennedy, from the Center wing of the National Progressive Party, today clinched a narrow victory over the Republican Democrats to become the next President. In his acceptance speech, Kennedy earnesty thanked the American people for putting their trust in him, and promised that he would prove that this trust was well placed.\n\nThe brother of former President John F. Kennedy, Bobby has vowed to honor his brother's legacy by championing the cause of civil rights even further, and to address the issues of poverty and income inequality to create a better and fairer America for everyone. Cynics believe him to be too bold and idealistic to succeed, but millions of Americans earnestly believe him to be the man who can change America.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.21.t:0 "George Wallace Elected US President"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.21.d:0 "Few expected the result, and even fewer can contain their shock. George Wallace, nominee for the Far-Right faction of the National Progressive Party, has narrowly won the presidency after one of the most contentious and least civil election races in American history. As a triumphant Wallace gave his acceptance speech, he proudly declared that "the American people have called out in one united voice, and they make one simple demand - stop this nonsense at once!"\n\nNobody can fail to interpret the target of these words, as the segregationist candidate has run on a platform of staunch opposition to the previously ascendant civil rights movement. Renewed clashes between segregationists and civil rights activists have broken out across the South, and Martin Luther King and other prominent voices have condemned the sudden reactionary turn of events.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.22.d:0 "In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the Caudillos and the Turkish President have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.23.d:0 "With Germany still consumed by the chaos of civil war and many of its territories becoming plagued with conflicts of their own, German Africa has today announced its intention to weather this terrible storm. Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the 'immoral, colonial alliance', many within the German Sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent.\n"

Yet as observers report increasing militarization of the South African border by the newly formed Afrika-Schild, many consider the German response to be self-evident.\n"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.25.d:0 "As the Boer rebellion rages on, international journalists on the ground are reporting that German colonial panzer divisions have now begun to pour across the South African border in a rapid escalation of the conflict. Forces of the newly formed 'Afrika-Schild' have already won several key victories, forcing already stretched thin South African soldiers into retreating south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for almost a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by quickly spreading footage of a battle bloody South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, who asked the cameras the question that many have been asking:\n\n'Where the fuck are the Yankees?'\n"

These long simmering tensions have exploded today, as Turkish president Alparslan Türkeş has announced that a state of war now exists between the Turkish Republic and the Italian Empire.\n\nDespite being former allies, the war has already proven extremely popular in Turkey. Young nationalists and party members march through the streets of Ankara, calling on Türkeş to "Lead Us to Victory". Comparatively, in Italy certain voices in the PNF have shown little to no support for the war, with many questioning what is the point of their spoils if they cannot properly manage them?.\n"

Surely, if the communes are making any kind of stir for the first time in twenty years, it must be in some form important.\n\nReports speak of stirrings from the religious. Those few traders who make their way that far north over the east Siberian trade routes have spoken of entire communes chanting in prayer, of churches being filled to the brim, and of some figure pushing them onward. Nobody knows exactly what has spurred this action, but the people of Siberia keep praying for one man.\n\nThey call him, the Father.\n"

In a speech to the nation today, Führer Hermann Göring has declared his anger at continued chaos in Africa, and that German troops would be sent to restore order in the southern Reichskomissariats and reinforce the proud garrisons of the dark continent.\n\nWith chaos in Germany it had been widely assumed that the African Reichskomissar would be abandoned to their fate. Now, the new Fuhrer's decision to reinforce Germany's colonies has brought the world perilously close to open conflict between two nuclear armed superpowers, even as no official declaration of war has been made."

He made it clear that he would accept nothing less than the total removal of foreign troops from Africa, although many observers believe he would settle a negotiated peace.\n\nThe move surprised few. A war fought across the world in just the thing to restore the German people's spirit following a war fought at home. The speech ended with a parade celebrating the Aryan will and Germany's eventual triumph over America and the OFN."

The former Wehrmacht commander is notably averse to military engagements and has reportedly questioned the value of intervening to defend "profitless hell-holes".\n\nNonetheless, it seems that the cabal of generals that surrounds the Führer have managed to convince him to engage the Americans and South Africans after all. So far, Germany has sent only a handful of special-forces and logistical units into battle, but more are likely to come. While they will no doubt come as a relief to the embattled RK's, time will tell if it's enough to turn the tide."

Germany lies largely in ruins, its people are wrought with trauma and starvation and dissident followers of the defeated Führers infest every corner of the nation. But despite these problems, or perhaps because of them, the Reich has decided to join its colonies' war.\n\nAlready, Schörner has sent units of the long-suffering Volkssturm accompanied by shock troops to join the fight.

DEMOWORLDEVENT.74.desc:0 "For the first time since the war in the 1950s, West Russia is united under one banner. Unfortunately for the country and the world, that banner is the swastika. The first transmissions and declarations coming from the region talk about the cryptic Aryan Brotherhood, a society of Russians who believe that being Aryan is not based on race, but is a state the Slavic race can achieve, thus becoming equal to their conquerors.\n\nAs insane and unlikely as this sounds, the Brotherhood under the rule of one Gutrum Vagner is now in control of West Russia. They have announced their success and their equality to the "Reykh". The world looks silently in awe and confusion, as they wait for what happens next. What will be the future moves of this new Russian warlord state, and what will be the reaction of the mighty Reich to this absurd entity?"

DEMOWORLDEVENT.76.desc:0 "Born out of the ashes of the WRRF, the small Republic of Komi managed to survive between larger rivals in its region. A safe haven for political radicals from all sides of the spectrum, the Republic became increasingly unstable, but in the end, the status quo held. The [NIK.GetRulingParty], party that has led the republic since its infancy, have managed to eliminate their various shades of radical opposition, and ensured that West Russia is united once again.\n\nA declaration written by the President has been released, stating that Komi has been replaced by the West Russian Free Republic, which is not limited in the territory it used to hold as an ASSR, but encompasses much more. This has proven to be a turning point, and marks the final defeat of the rivals to the democratic warlord state in the region. It now seems that a new contender for the control of Russia has appeared.\n"

Disappearing into the anarchy after the war, the ROA's reappearance today has been quite a shock for Russian observers. The new nation's long term prospects remain uncertain."

While the approval from noble émigrés has been nearly unanimous, others have denounced the Emperor's government as a restoration of tyranny. The major powers, meanwhile, remain silent on the issue, waiting to see what happens next before making any diplomatic overtures.\n\nDespite its successes, Vyatka's government still only controls roughly a third of Russia. It remains to be seen whether they will prove capable of governing even that. Whatever the final outcome, this event will surely have a major impact on Russia for years to come."

The West Russian Revolutionary Front, long thought crushed under the German boot, has spread and tightened its grip over West Russia and tamed the many battling warlords under the watchful eye of Grand Marshal Alexander Altunin.\n\nKnown for his adherence to orthodox Marxism-Leninism, Grand Marshal Altunin already has put the people to work restoring order and Socialism to the formerly lawless land, all the while mustering the Red Army in the east. It would seem that the Grand Marshal plans to fulfill his predecessor's dream of a reunited USSR, or die trying."

The threats to the regime are few and small, with most experts on Russian affairs agreeing that a force equal to the old socialist republic has arisen. However, the dictatorship's leader, [TOB.GetLeader], has refrained from making correlations with the WSPR, preferring to portray his regime as a new one."

The remnants of the West Siberian People's Republic have reconsolidated control over the area from their base in Tyumen and now stand poised to make a play for the rest of Russia.\n\nGeneral Secretary Lazar Kaganovich, an avid supporter of the obscure Soviet official Joseph Stalin, believes that large-scale centralization of industry and political power is the only way to avoid repeating the mistakes of the old Soviet Union.

Promising a return to a pre-war quality of life, Yazov enjoys great popularity, and his military reforms suggest a strong emphasis on the reunification of Russia. With the League's back to the Urals, and with Central Siberia seemingly looming ever closer, the future of the region seems uncertain and turbulent."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.86.desc:0 "Sporadic news reports and announcements coming from Central Siberia have confirmed that the region has fallen under the control of a previously obscure entity known as the Siberian Black Army. Based on the teachings of Nestor Makhno from the days of the Russian Civil War, a society following militarized anarchism was formed, where the population was not protected by the state, but by local militia and their commanders that were to protect the communes and their anarchist system.\n\nThis ideology, first adopted in the lands between the Central Siberian Republic and Genrikh Yagoda's Supreme Soviet as both governments collapsed, has now been asserted over the entirety of the CSR's former territory by the use of armed force by this new Black Army, despite all the challenges that such a system has introduced."

Despite all the challenges it has faced due to the rival government of Mengjiang occupying much of Mongolia, the socialist state has looked elsewhere to expand to, specifically the rest of Central Siberia.\n\nThe Council has defeated its formidable enemies in the region, and has now claimed the entirety of it in the name of the "new Soviet Union" they seek to establish. Elsewhere in Russia, rival warlords spectate, either with admiration or concern, this new challenger for national dominance."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.88.desc:0 "What began as a large splinter faction from the Central Siberian Republic in the days of its decline has now managed to claim its mantle. The state of Novosibirsk, led by Alexander Pokryshkin, has had a turbulent history. The rival government was formed as a violent backlash to measures taken during the Siberian War, and maintained an uneasy coexistence with the city state of Barnaul.\n\nSoon, though, it managed to overcome its political challenges by utilizing its large population, agricultural base and industry, and turned to the expansion and reunification of Central Siberia. This has obviously succeeded, as its last enemies have been defeated, and Pokryshkin now rules as a benevolent despot of the region."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.88.a:0 "The linchpin of Russia has been united."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.89.t:0 "Kemerovo Unifies Central Siberia!"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.89.desc:0 "Reports from the lands of Central Siberia are conflicting and uncertain, but what is for certain is that the region has experienced unprecedented upheaval with the expansion of the warlord state of Nikolai Krylov. The former Soviet general had sided with the fledgling Central Siberian Republic, before defecting during the Siberian War, establishing his own clique and giving himself the title of Supreme Ruler, Autocrat and King of Rus, Rurik II, after the medieval prince that founded the Rurikid dynasty.\n\nThis unusual identity he has assumed has now become well-known in Russia and abroad, as his Kingdom has wrestled control over wide swaths of land. Other nations look with awe at this new and absurd faction, that now has a shot at Russian reunification."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.90.t:0 "Tomsk Unifies Central Siberia!"
DEMOWORLDEVENT.90.desc:0 "In the reign of chaos that is typical for the Russian warlord states a beacon of freedom and democracy may have appeared. The old government of the Central Siberian Republic, forced to retreat to the city of Tomsk after its collapse, has recently issued an announcement declaring that the region is now back under one state, their own.\n\nLittle is known about the political factions that once dominated this republic's politics, but it appears that the group known as the Humanists has secured its government. Founded by well-known composer Dmitri Shostakovich and continued by his protégé Moisey Vainberg, it is a group of artists that wishes for a humane and democratic republic which protects its citizens. That exact dream has apparently been achieved."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.91.desc:0 "In a strange turn of events, the windswept taiga of the Russian Far East is now reportedly under the control of the forces of Konstantin Rodzaevsky, longtime leader of the Russian Fascist Party. While the idea of Russians embracing fascism may seem bizarre, many analysts point to the RFP's key role in the All-Russian Expeditionary Force as a precedent. Some have already proclaimed this little more than the Force reasserting it's authority.\n\nWhat comes next for Rodzaevsky's regime is uncertain. Logically the RFP will probably begin a push into Siberia proper in an effort to unify Russia. How this clique will interact with the international system is uncertain. Although the RFP and Rodzaevsky have long enjoyed the patronage of Japanese backers, his vision of a fascist Russia is clearly more in-line with the German model, considering his party's virulent anti-Semitism and usage of Nazi iconography. The consequences of this development remain to be seen.\n"

However, the recent development caused it appear in headlines for the first time since 50s. After holding on to his domain of Irkutsk for a long time, Yagoda managed to destroy other contenders for the Russian rule in the region, once again reasserting his dominance in the outskirts of the former Soviet Union.\n\nWith his close enemies eliminated, Chairman Yagoda now seeks to fully reinforce his claim as a legitimate successor of Bukharin's state and expand his power to the western frontiers of Siberia. The apparent rebirth of the Soviet successor state became a source of alarm for its Siberian neighbors while the international community looks forward to the future of Russia with a great concern.\n"

Popular amongst the youth and the dreamers of Siberia, one must nevertheless wonder just how dedicated Sablin, barely an adult, is to his dream of a truly equal Union. Whatever the case, the men and women of the Far East march west, determined to bring their ideas to all of Russia."

It is widely theorized that Tsar Mikhail was was used as a puppet for other reactionary generals and remains one, but that remains uncertain. What matters for now is that Russian monarchism has made its return, albeit far from the nation's core lands."

DEMOWORLDEVENT.95.desc:0 "Word has traveled down from the quiet tundras of the Russian Far East. A frontier long abandoned by any national authority for decades, a new contender for power now arises there, perhaps against all odds. Mikhail Matkovsky, the leader of the rebellious branch of the Russian Fascist Party based in the port city of Magadan, has established himself as the premier authority in the Far Eastern region.\n\nA pragmatic fascist of some repute, Matkovsky and his allies first split from the original party in Amur due to the Rodzaevsky's excesses and support for the Nazis during the Great Patriotic War. Now the rest of the world waits with bated breath to see how much further this old Russian fascist can go. The winds of fate blew Russia to the reds once upon a time, and now that tide may reverse its course."

He announced that Vice President John F. Kennedy would be sworn in as his replacement, praising Kennedy's character and describing him as a "unifier". He went on to extoll the successes of his presidency, in both foreign and domestic policy.\n\nProgressives have praised Kennedy's record on civil rights, and members of the NPP and R-Ds alike have expressed their support of Nixon's resigning. Segregationists, however, are skeptical, fearing that Kennedy would continue to advance a pro-civil rights agenda."
DEMOWORLDEVENT.145.a:0 "Maybe President Kennedy will heal the nation."

POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "John Fitzgerald Kennedy's path to political prominence was one overshadowed by others' controversies. Scion of the powerful Kennedy family and son of President Joseph Kennedy, John found himself recalled from the Pacific front after his elder brother Joseph Jr.'s death, and had been groomed to follow in his father's steps ever since. In the years following the 1948 election and the implosion of the Democratic Party, the Kennedys (with the exception of John's brother Robert) loyally followed the shattered remnants of the party to the GOP, becoming members of the Republican-Democrat Party. Some predicted that John's career would be tainted by the failures of Kennedy the Elder's administration, but John's personal charisma and political savvy were enough to help him grow out of his father's shadow. In 1960, he was on the Republican-Democrats' victorious Vice Presidential ticket. Unfortunately, his running mate was Richard Nixon.\n\nNow, John finds himself thrust into leadership of a nation in turmoil, one that desperately looks toward him for guidance. But for every American who sees him as a beacon of stability, there is one who sees him as an obstacle: ardent segregationists fear that his idealism will lead to him furthering civil rights legislation, and committed progressives scorn him for not being as impassioned as his brother Robert. Fate has ordained John F. Kennedy be the one to steer the ship of state, but will he be the one to guide it out of dangerous waters?"

 DEMOWORLDEVENT.1104.desc:0 "Darkness falls on the Kazakh lands. The extremely xenophobic and nationalistic state in Aktau, once demeaned by their rivals as an insignificant, if fearsome, contender, have exterminated every opposing force in their struggle for power in Kazakhstan. To commemorate the final victory over the last remnants of the degenerate wreckers, massive celebrations in honor of Supreme Leader Safa Gaziz were held all across the country. The waves of Slavic refugees, as well as Gaziz's political opponents, are attempting to escape Kazakhstan to avoid the fate of their less fortunate countrymen who were caught by the Kazakh Blueshirts.\n\nHaving accomplishing his messianic quest as the father of a purified Kazakh state, Gaziz doesn't think his mission has come to an end. Strongly believing in the righteousness of the Nazi doctrine, the Kazakh Führer turned his eyes on the Reich, wishing to accompany the Reich's mission against the Slavic threat.\n\n"

 DEMOWORLDEVENT.1105.desc:0 "News from the Kazakh steppes rarely reach the international observers, and those that do usually leave more questions than answers. The state of "New Polska", a former Soviet autonomous republic and the current refuge for Polish exiles fom the Reich, has established full military control over Kazakhstan in attempts to repel the aggression into their new homeland.\n\nTo assure its security, the Polish government took measures to establish a friendly Kazakh republic and set up a buffer zone in Aktobe between two nations. While the peace in Central Asia has been achieved after years of warlord warfare, the prospects of the Polish-dominated Kazakhstan are yet to be seen.\n"

 DEMOWORLDEVENT.1106.desc:0 "The Kazakh people, left without spiritual guidance after the Soviet collapse, now seeks refuge with Allah, the Lord of Mankind. Nikolay Zabelkin of Kostanay, a warlord turned a pious man, achieved his victory over the secular sovereigns of Kazakhstan and expanded his Islamic fundamentalist rule over the whole country. A land of anarchy before, Kazakhstan is now a territory governed not by artificial human rules, but by the laws sent by God himself.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Kazakhstan showed their little concern with the affairs of the sinful earth and decided to turn themselves to isolationism, away from the temptations of the foreign world. The gates of Kazakhstan, once unguarded, are now closed to non-believers."
