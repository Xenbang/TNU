 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_KILCHICHAKOV_DESC:0 "Mikhail Eremeevich Kilchichakov is quite the Renaissance man: he dabbles in poetry, has penned several plays, and he served in the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War. What he has little care for, however, are the ideological squabbles that have overtaken everywhere outside of his home city of Krasnoyarsk. When he was wounded in battle and sent back home, he refused to let the city he loved fall to the same chaos he saw on his way home from the front. It was the same fear that drove him to set his literary career aside and enter the political sphere. It was the same fear that led him to suspend mayoral elections when he won, to prevent destabilizing and chaotic transfers of power. It was the same fear that led him to order the garrison to begin raiding villages in enemy territory, since they were probably full of brigands who would attack them if they did not strike first.\n\nKilchichakov is willing to do whatever it takes for him and his city to survive, even if it means making some unsavory alliances. In the past, he has pledged loyalty to Yagoda's provisional regime, the People's Republic of Western Siberia, the People's Revolutionary Council in Mongolia, and even the fascist outpost in the Amur. And every time, he minimized his commitment to their causes, and broke ties the moment he feared that their influence began to encroach a bit too far. If another warlord grows powerful enough, then Kilchichakov is prepared to do the whole song and dance routine again to make sure that his city will stay safe. Even if it means paying lip service to a cause all others despise, or invading other city-states to put Krasnoyarsk further behind the front lines. People may revile him, but one day they will understand why he made these sacrifices. At least, he hopes they will."
