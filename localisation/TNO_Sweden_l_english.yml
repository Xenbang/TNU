#Leader Descriptions:
POLITICS_OLOF_PALME_NOTUSED_DESC:0 "A champion of the Swedish labor in his adult years, Olof Palme could not boast about coming from a humble background, being born into a well-to-do Conservative Lutheran family in Stockholm. A sickly child with much time to read books, he learned the English, French and German languages at a young age, something would benefit him greatly later in life. During the Second World War, Palme briefly served the Swedish army and experienced the worst of the nation's fear of a German invasion. Palme would go the United States to continue his education and it was here that he began to formulate his political ideas. Meetings with the National Progressive Front introduced him to the issues of racism and class struggle, while a brief journey to Asia showed him the horrors of the Japanese imperialism. Returning to Sweden in the late 50s, Palme was ready to enter Swedish politics. The 1958 election saw him enter the first chamber of parliament and his service in various government agencies made him even more popular as a semi-radical and progressive figure. Within two years he was made Deputy Prime Minister and in late 1961, Tage Erlander retired in favor of his protegé.\n\nAlthough he has not served long as Prime Minister, Olof Palme has quickly made quite the impression. His skills as an orator proved vital when the public first reacted to such a young man becoming their next Head of Government. The visits of Prime Minister to certain diplomatically isolated countries proved to very contentious by the Swedish concerned population and the world community alike, especially his visit to Communist Cuba. The Prime Minister did not hesitate to make some subtle jabs at the dictatorships that dominate Europe, while simultaneously upholding a cautious appeasement policy. 1962 begins and Olof Palme now starts his tenure in earnest. His policies are often criticized as controversial and sometimes even unpopular, but no one can claim that he hasn't taken to his new role well."
POLITICS_TAGE_ERLANDER_DESC:0 "In 1945, Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson died suddenly while stepping off a train in Stockholm. Hansson left an immense legacy in his wake. His tenure as head of government had dramatically altered the state of the Swedish nation and at the time of his death he had shown no sign of wishing to stop. So it fell, somewhat unexpectedly, to Minister of Education Tage Erlander to take the reins of both the Social Democratic Party and Sweden itself. Erlander's government was formed at a time of great uncertainty for Sweden. Europe, as the country had known it, was now gone; replaced by Germany's new order. Sweden was now the only Scandinavian country not under direct German rule. Even as the war in Europe came to a close, it seemed possible that the country might not survive that way for long. In order to prevent such a fate, Erlander opened Sweden to trade and cooperation with Germany. This decision quickly became the core argument against the Social Democratic government; as the People's Party began to take a clear pro-american stance.\n\nSince those days, Erlander has proven himself to be a diligent disciple of the Hansson days. While not as charismatic as his predecessor, the Prime Minister's policies have kept him popular. Universal health insurance, larger pensions and expanded child care are but some of the reforms implemented during the late forties and fifties. Much of this has been affordably achieved due to the small size of the army, as well as the surprising benefits to trade with Germany.\n\nHowever, all is not well in Sweden. Erlander is more than aware of Germany's subtle attempts to influence the nation; something that the opposition is very public about too. The coming years will demonstrate if the price paid for 'Folkhemmet' can still be justified."

#ideas
SWE_folkhemmet:0 "Folkhemmet"
SWE_folkhemmet_desc:0 "The model of the Swedish state is one where the state acts as a home for the people. A home in which its residents are sheltered from the elements of nature. If a "home" leaves its inhabitants to die at the jaws of a wolf, or at the mercy of a storm, is it truly an abode at all? Similarly, what is a state if it cannot protect her people from the unpredictable elements of everyday life, or from the hostile actors in an ever changing environment?\n\nIndeed, the Swedish state exists not for prestige, nor for grandeur, but for her people. It facilitates the social and political participation of a populace whose most basic needs are never put into question. A bastion of warmth in a cold world."
SWE_schwedenisierung:0 "Careful Collaboration"
SWE_schwedenisierung_desc:0 "The Swedish state, despite being popularly known as a bastion of light and liberty, is in close collaboration with an empire which can only be described as quite the opposite. Surrounded by the Germans and their empire, the Unity Pakt, Sweden partakes in constructive and close collaboration with the German Reich -- and it has proven to be a boon. German industrial investments provide direct employment for thousands of Swedes.\n\nSo long as the Swedish government occasionally bends for the Reich, the Germans are content to maintain this beneficial relationship. The Reich's grasp upon Sweden is much less of a stranglehold, and more of a warm handshake, and with this, the people of Sweden are content."
SWE_exports_to_germany:0 "Exports to Germany"
SWE_exports_to_germany_desc:0 "The demands of the mighty German industries are great, and with great industries, comes a great demand for ores. Swedish mining firms have made great use of this, employing many thousands of Swedes in iron mines across the country and profiting handsomely. Additionally, German firms, such as Reichswerke, have been granted concessions to run large mines within the country, employing hundreds of imported slaves to extract the bounties beneath Swedish soil(who are quietly documented as migrant labourers). As a result, Sweden enjoys some rather large trading privileges with the nations of the Unity Pakt. Privileges that, to any Swedish businessmen, are worth far greater than the lives of some foreign slaves."

SWE.200.t:0 "The Viking Program"
SWE.200.d:0 "With the German onslaught wearing down on our people, we have had to find creative new methods to break our enemies. We may not have enough bullets to kill every Hun who crosses the sea, or misguided brothers from our fellow Scandinavian nations, or the multitude of others they have dragged into their insane endeavor, we can however break them mentally. As such, General Göransson has proposed a new plan of action. The Viking Program.\n\nCapitalizing on the fantastical view the Germans seem to hold of our heritage, Göransson and a team of scientists and military theorists have proposed to move development towards ways to break the Germans morale. Already, he has prepared a unit with his new method. The Odin Division, as he calls them, has had their vehicles attached with large speaker systems, and their men have rehearsed a number of chants and other such calls in the old language. On the battlefield, they are to blast strange, loud, and disturbing music that has slowly become popular in our nation, while chanting old hymns from where the Germans can not see them. Göransson claims that this will strike fear in the Germans hearts, and give us a chance to bleed them dry."
SWE.200.a:0 "A novel idea! Just don't let them play that drivel near the capital."
SWE.200.b:0 "Our focus needs to be in more practical methods."

SWE.201.t:0 "British Volunteers Arrive!"
SWE.201.d:0 "With the Germans marching into our nation, we have found new 'allies' across the world ready to help. While the arms and men from America, Japan and Italy were to be expected, recently we have been surprised to find smaller nations throwing their hat into the ring. One of which has been the English, who have appeared on our doorstep in a group of Scottish cargo ships carrying papers that claim the thousand or so volunteers are merely Scottish tourists and ship workers and that the guns in their hold are shipments of potatoes.\n\nThe Brits are a motley of seasoned resistance fighters and starry eyed volunteers, but all of them have seen firsthand the cruelty the Germans can inflict on an occupied nation, and claim they are willing to die to prevent the same from happening again. With them they carry a message from their mysterious leader, who claims that they will send more when able, and if Sweden is to fall, they will use their knowledge to continue the fight from the underground."
SWE.201.a:0 "True heroes!"
